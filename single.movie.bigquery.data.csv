"73",1467215223,"marvelstudios","ibanezjerk","self.marvelstudios",141,742,742,0,"Opening scene I hope we get in Spider-Man: Homecoming","In that scene in CW where Peter is in his bedroom with Tony, Peter talks about his day. He says caught the bus (or train, can't remember), found a perfectly good DVD player in the dumpster, and nailed his algebra test.

What I'd like to see in Homecoming is how his day *really* went.

I'm not great at coming up with the story, but as an example I'd love for it to be that he *actually* failed his algebra test. Not because he didn't study or whatever but because he showed up at the last 5 minutes of class because he was busy being Spider-man.

Maybe he gets thrown into the dumpster by an enemy or bully and while in there, he get's sidetracked / moment of ""A.D.D."" where he's like, ""Hey sweet, a DVD player!""

And catching the train would also unfold in an interesting way. Then we see him walk in his house and deliver that line about a really nice car parked out front, seeing Tony for the first time. Cut to Marvel Comic Book pages flipping intro.

Anyway, I feel that there are a lot of ways they can go about it but I think seeing an introductory scene like this would make that scene from Civil War fun to revisit. Plus I don't want to revisit an origin, but I think it would be cool to get a glimpse of Peter before meeting Tony.

edit: I get that some of these things may not fit his personality but I think it would still be interesting to bridge the two movies with some take on this day he described.","4qg7uu",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

http://reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/6j3gk2/guy_who_saw_homecoming_here_alright_heres_your/

I attended a screening this morning at an AMC in Los Angeles. I don't want to give out any spoilers, and no, I have no way of officially proving that I've seen it. My best form of proof I can provide (that can't be verified until the movie releases) is that the Marvel Studios logo doesn't appear until after the opening scene while the Sony ones are at the beginning. 

The movie is excellent. The high school stuff is a big focus in the film and Spidey's personal troubles  haven't been translated this well on screen before, with the Spectacular Spider-Man show being the only thing coming close.

I really liked Zendaya in the movie. Her character Michelle is mean to Peter, but you can tell she's one of the only people really paying attention to him. She played her character really well and I can't wait to see more of her. 

Martin Starr really threw me off in the movie. Not because he's bad, he's great, but after years of watching him on Silicon Valley, it's weird seeing him not be a monotone asshole. He's very cheery in the movie. 

This is very much Spidey's movie. Tony is 100% a supporting player. The reports of Tony having minimal screentime are true. 

Vulture is great. Keaton plays him very well, and this is the first Marvel villain in a while that feels so fleshed out. His motivations feel justified, and his story isn't so black and white, which is a trait of any great villain. He's up there with Loki and Winter Soldier. 

The humor in the movie is great and feels very natural. None of the high school stuff feels forced at all and they manage to capture a teenage experience pretty well. It's no ""Edge of Seventeen,"" but for a superhero movie, it's surprisingly authentic. The movie feels very much like Bendis' Ultimate Spider-Man comic, and brings everything that comic did so well to the screen. 

Oh, and Bendis and Sara Pichelli get a shoutout in the credits, probably for Ned being a straight adaption of Ganke. 

There are two scenes at the end. One during the credits, and one after. One's more fun while the other is setup. 

EDIT: Alright, I posted some more proof in a comment. It's as non-spoilerish as I want to get, but I do mention some sequences in the movie. I'm on mobile, so I can't properly post a formatted spoiler comment. 

EDIT 2: Screw it, I'll just post the contents of my comment here in the post:

Alright, here's some more details: 

The screening was for movie theater managers. I had a friend who knew someone working for the screening, so they were able to get my name on the list. 

It was at 10 this morning at the Century City AMC. It was in IMAX, but it was one of those smaller IMAXes that was basically just an upgraded normal-sized screen. 

We didn't have to put our phones in bags or anything, we were just asked to turn them off and security would approach anyone that had them out during the film. They asked a woman to put her phone away during the credits that was sitting behind me. 

Here's some stuff about the movie that's specific, but not really spoilery. Two Ramones songs play during the movie. One during a montage of him doing stuff we've seen of him on patrol from the trailers (can't remember which song), and Blitzkrieg Bop plays during the credits. 

The first part of the credits feature animation, like other MCU films. It's a kind of silly paint-style credits sequence that's very modern art-ish. Spider-Man heads in a field with a masked burglar running through them, Spidey swinging around, webbing up the same burglar. A little reminiscent of the animated Deadpool in the Deadpool credits, but doesn't look hand drawn. 

Oh, and as far as I can tell, there was no social media embargo. We didn't have to sign anything and we weren't asked to not post about it. 

EDIT 3: Okay, here's a plot point that's revealed early on in the film, even before the Marvel Studios logo. Don't read if you don't want to know anything!

.
.
.
It's revealed that Toomes has been running his operation as the Vulture since 2012. His operation has gone completely under the radar and it isn't until Spider-Man comes along that they start getting noticed. How they've gone unnoticed for so long is revealed in the film. 

EDIT 4: NO, THE SPOILER PM TRAIN IS NO LONGER A THING. Read the comments, guys. Sorry. I might make a post over in /r/marvelstudiosspoilers, but I haven't decided yet. Please stop messaging me. My poor inbox. ","6ix1wl",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

What if the series is attempting to pull off a Harry Potter type feel. Perhaps Midtown high will play as a familiar feel like Hogwarts. Just like the HP films the teachers will play a larger roles in shaping Peter as a character.

Also Fieige has made it pretty clear that Peter's highschool life, will be  a large part of the series. Frankly the HP style of following Harry throughout the years, would work perfectly for this new Spider-man.

This is also a style I hope they use for his friends as well. Have Harry Osborn be like Ron, and maybe Zendaya's character would act as a Hermoine. I think this works way better than the previous franchises, where Harry O. and Peter stop being real friends after one film. 

Just to be fair, I am not saying to copy Harry Potter Directly, Peter obviously has a life outside of school....
I just think this would be a really new and different set up for the character. 

Anyway, those are my two cents. What do ya'll think? 


Edit: Whoa this got more attention than I was expecting. I love this sub, thanks for reading!

They are two heroes who operate literally blocks away from each other. Spider-Man isn't the only hero in NYC. By the time the film comes out we'll have Luke Cage, Cloak and Dagger, Iron Fist and Jessica Jones calling NYC their home too. Maybe the others might not get a mention but there is no reason for Daredevil not to get a namedrop at least. By the time they finished the script, DD Season 1 was most likely already out. There should be no reason for him to get ignored. I'm not saying I want his character to appear in flesh and blood but maybe we could get a wink and a nod like a newspaper clipping in J.J Jonah's office talking about the Devil of Hell's Kitchen. Or even the supposed leaked script was perfect for the cameo they gave him in that. Don't know if it's true or not, but one can hope. I just want more interconnectivity between films and TV shows. Marvel likes to brag that it's all connected but we've honestly only seen that happen between the films. Now that Perlmutter is out, we need to see some interconnectivity between the films and TV shows as well. Some of you might say that it destroys the uniqueness of the film by showhorning chars in but if Iron Man can appear in Spidey's movie, why can't DD at least get a namedrop? If Thor and Hulk can team up in a movie, why can't other heroes get some sort of cameo?

That all being said however, there is one thing I hope the MCU doesn't forget...

Peter Parker (almost) never wins. Spider-Man can catch the bad guys, defeat the villain, save the day, all the classic hero stuff. But at the end of the day, he's still just a kid missing curfew, grades slipping, getting grounded, ignored by girls, broke as a joke, can't seem to win, Peter Parker. And this is where the true essence of Spider-Man lies. 

Not to say that we revel in his misery, but we relate to it so strongly that it's become a huge part of how we all picture ourselves underneath that mask; it's what helps make this larger than life character one of the most human super-beings in all of fiction. 

I'm so excited for Homecoming, and I've been waiting far too long to see a Spider-Man who properly jokes his way through foiling a robbery (""you have the right to remain silent!"" absolutely sold me). Yet I truly hope the MCU remembers that at the heart of the story is a kid who has suffered greatly in his short time on earth, and who has learned the hard way the true meaning of the word loss.

Having said that, if this turns out to be true, I'll be very happy.

Needless to say, possible MASSIVE SPOILERS. You have been warned.

***

* The film begins with Spider-man thwarting a bank heist in the beginning of the morning, taking down all of the thugs except for one. The final robber and threatens to blow the head off his victim if Spider-man doesn't let him go. Spider-man responds by doing nothing except for flashing the Spider Signal on him and threatening to summon the spiders, which scares the thug into surrendering. Peter collects pictures he took of the event to turn into the Daily Bugle after school.
* While the police are collecting witness statements, one woman says ""Daredevil saved us!"" and she's corrected by another guy who explains that it was their friendly neighborhood Spider-man. Spidey is met with appraisal by the people of New York, and the title card appears.
* As soon as he takes of the costume, life starts shitting on him. Peter arrives late for school and misses a test that he is unable to make-up. He's basically invisible to everyone except Harry and the students who think that he's loser. Liz Allen however, who is dating Flash Thompson, seems to have a thing for Peter. Flash is obviously jealous of Peter and is constantly trying to instigate with him, but Peter never budges. Harry tries to get Peter to join the Homecoming Dance Committee that he and Liz are a part of but Peter declines, explaining that he has enough on his plate with school and making up the work he misses.
* After school, Peter turns in the photos to J. Jonah Jameson whose excuse for underpaying Peter is getting the pictures to him late, despite having had to go to school and being the only pictures of Spider-man foiling the robbery since the criminals took out the cameras. JJJ reveals that one of the thugs (by the name of Herman Shultz) actually got away with some of the money and JJJ twists the story into accusing Spider-man of working with the criminals, allowing them to get away before the police arrive. 
* Peter returns home to get chastised from Aunt May who's received a call home from school about Peter's chronic tardiness. Peter responds by handing her the little money he got from freelancing at the Bugle. She goes easy on Peter, realizing he's been trying to do a lot for May after losing Uncle Ben and the house. Because of his age and the city, Peter is unable to find any other work. May tries to set Peter up on a date with a friend's niece who she's been trying to for weeks, but Peter declines, using schoolwork as the usual excuse.
* Norman Osborn's ""Oscorp"" boomed in productivity shortly after the collapse of SHIELD, hiring many of its scientists and resources. It is a fast growing enterprise, perhaps one of the fastest, projected to rival even Stark Industries within the next decade. Many of the world's top scientists are employed at Oscorp, from Adrian Toomes to Otto Octavius. The former is the antagonist of the film, while the latter, among others, is just name-dropped.
* Toomes lives alone with his daughter and has earned the nickname of ""the Vulture"" for making a career out of refurbishing old or dying scientific advances in fresh, innovative ways. His newest venture is a winged exosuit based off of the technology used by Iron Man, War Machine and the Falcon. Unable to create a battery or arc-reactor powerful enough to run the suit, the proto-type is only able to run on the wearer's vitals for a short amount of time.
* Osborn suggests human test trials, but Toomes argues that it would be illegal and unethical as the suit is not ready. Prolonged exposure would lead to fatally ill side-effects, causing the wearer to age rapidly after removing the suit. Osborn has the tests run behind Toomes' back anyways, and the human subjects age rapidly just as Toomes had predicted. 
* When Toomes learns Osborn ran the tests behind his back, Osborn convinces Toomes that the suit is a success. Though he believes Osborn, the lie isn't enough to ethically convince Toomes to allow Osborn to get away with his crimes. He threatens to reveal Osborn as the fraud he is and in response, Osborn frames Toomes, hoping the scandal will be public enough to get the project the funding it needs.
* With his name slandered, Toomes himself breaks into Oscorp to destroy the exosuit. When security corners Toomes, he puts on the exosuit himself and breaks out of Oscorp. He returns home to his daughter and explains that they have to leave. She refuses to leave with a criminal, and Toomes is forced to escape alone into an abandoned warehouse that he makes his new base of operations. Though he is tempted to exact his revenge on Osborn, he chooses not to go down that path, believing he's already done enough to slander his own name and lose his daughter. Toomes begins experiencing the side effects and accelerated aging. 
* He plans to break back into Oscorp to get the research and technology he needs to revert the side-effects. Until then, he creates a way to reverse engineer the suit to feed off of other's life forces instead of his own, through the talons. He uses it on rodents and small animals to keep the suit from killing him. but believe that eventually they will not be enough.
* Peter Parker gets into a fight with Flash Thompson for ""flirting with his girl"" where he decides not to fight back and Flash hits him directly in the jaw. While Parker plays the punch off as if it hurt immensely, Flash tries to play off the punch as if it didn't almost shatter his hand. Among other issues, the fight is the last straw for Liz, and the two break up. Liz begins showing more interest in Peter, and Peter has no idea how to handle it. 
* Peter reveals to Harry that he really has been crushing on Liz for some time, and Harry Osborn pushes Peter to make his move. Because their relationship has just ended, Peter responds that ""he isn't some kind of vulture"", following it up with ""But he is."" after discovering that Toomes is attacking Oscorp. Harry is freaking out because his father might be there, but Peter has to come up with an excuse so that he can go stop Toomes.
* Spider-man arrives as The Vulture leave Oscorp and the two duke it out in the city. Spider-man cracks on his old appearance and tries to rips out his flight systems, but Toomes explains that the flight systems are the most well protected parts of the suit. Spidey accidentally goes for the life-support system not realizing what it is, and Toomes has no choice but to escape with what he has and begin draining the energy of innocent victims.
* With Oscorp's private research and encrypted files, Toomes learns of a secret formula Norman had developed known as ""OZ"". Toomes believes that if he can replicate the OZ serum once more, it can reverse the accelerated aging and cure the side effects of the Vulture exosuit. There were no human test subjects, only animals, but he believes that it works and he can be the first. Until then, Toomes begins stealing the components he believes he needs to replicate the OZ formula, knowing that soon enough his talons won't be eventually begins to drain the life from living humans.
* Harry is upset at Peter for leaving when he was worried about his father, but Peter makes it up for him by deciding to join the Homecoming Dance Committee, much to Liz's excitement and Flash's disappointment. Flash's hand is put in a caste after the fight with Peter, but he blames it on punching a wall because he missed Liz so much. 
* The Homecoming Committee decides on making the school dance ""Avenger"" themed. While some of the faculty advise against this because of the controversy surrounding he Avengers as of late, the students outnumber the faculty and vote for theme virtually unanimously. Peter is always late to meetings because of Spider-man and the Bugle, but one day Harry offers to be Peter's wingman and gives Peter the courage he needs to ask out Liz. Peter offers to take Liz to the Oscorp Science Fair; at first she is weary, until he explains that it's just one of many activities at the carnival later that night.
* Toomes discovers his daughter Valeria is at the carnival and goes there to visit her, where he offers her the money and wealth he has been amassing for her. Valeria however shuns her father, considering him a monster for what he's done. She rejects him and the money, and Toomes considers this the final straw before declaring revenge on Osborn once and for all. When Peter meets Liz at the carnival, the Vulture begins his attack on the carnival to find Osborn. Spider-Man is forced to appear and battle Vulture, who gains the upperhand this time around.
* Osborn tells Toomes what he already knows, that the OZ formula was tested on various animals and never given human trials, and it was a failure. Toomes tells Osborn that he's turned him into a monster in the eyes of his daughter, and Osborn explains that he's done that himself. The suit's upgrades keep Peter from damaging the life support system same way as before, and Toomes uses his talons to drain Peter's energy, restoring youth and granting strength like never before. While Peter doesn't age, he is weakened immensely. Osborn makes his escape, causing Toomes to leave. 
* Tony unexpectedly picks up Peter from the carnival, and the two discuss Toomes on the way home. Stark reveals that he doesn't trust Osborn, and not just because he leads a rival company. The Accords keep Tony from directly helping stop Toomes, but he he can indirectly help Peter. Peter asks for schematics on the Iron Man and Falcon suits, and Stark tells them they're a little to advanced for him. When he shows them to Peter on a holoprint, Peter blows Tony away by understanding the tech immediately and building Toomes's suit from scratch. On the drive home, Peter and Tony figure out how to create an anti-magnetic inverter to stop Toomes without killing him. Peter also discusses the difficulty of balancing his responsibility with living a normal teenage life.
* Right before he drops him off, Stark also reveals he saw Peter spill the spaghetti with Liz and gives him some advice on how to deal with women. When Peter asks what Tony looks for in a woman, Tony says redheads. Peter says it's a shame he doesn't know any. Aunt May tries to set Peter up with a date to the Homecoming Dance, but Peter as usual doesn't trust his Aunt and rejects it. After the weekend is over, Flash berates Peter in front of Liz for being too afraid of the Vulture to stay with her at the Carnival, to which Peter immediately responds by asking her to the Homecoming Dance. Liz accepts the invitation, and Flash is left looking like a fool.
* The night of the dance, Peter receives a package from Stark containing the inverter. He stuffs it into his pocket and heads out to the dance to meet with Liz. Shortly after he arrives, The Vulture crashes the Midtown High Homecoming Dance to kidnap Harry. Peter switches into his Spider-man costume and realizes that the inverter is in his dress pants' pockets.
* When he finally retrieves it, he discovers it doesn't work unless it's within close range. Toomes realizes exactly what it is and destroys it before he can get close enough. Spidey eventually takes the battle outside where Flash Thompson and a few others run after to watch. Toomes realizes Spider-man is going out of his way to keep the casualties and collateral damage to a minimum (save for crashing through a cheap ice sculpture of the Avengers that leaves Tony, Vision, and half of War Machine. You know which half.) 
* He fires at the roof of the school to try collapse the gymnasium. He uses the distraction to take Harry and escape. Spider-man is able to save everyone in the gymnasium, and seeing that Liz is alone, assures her that Peter made it home safe. He webs her hand to Flash and tells them to make up. Liz is grossed out by the webbing, while Flash states that he's never washing his hand again.
* Spider-man heads over to Oscorp to meet with Norman who's just recieved a message from Toomes with directions to his abandoned warehouse, telling him to go alone. Norman follows his orders and Spider-man stays behind at Oscorp to fix the inverter. When Norman arrives, Toomes shows Harry all of the illegal experiments that Norman was responsible for. At first Harry backs away from his father, until his father twists the facts and explains everything he's done is for him and the memory of their mother.
* Harry forgives his father, and with his plan in shambles, Vulture prepares to kill Norman Osborn. Spider-Man leaps in the way, just in time, giving the Osborns ample time to escape. Peter takes the battles into the skies and throughout New York City, even passing by the old Avengers tower. The battle ends near Oscorp when Peter uses an amplified version of the inverter, and Toomes is caught in between two buildings like a fly caught in a web.
* Liz gets back together with Flash. As a result, however, Flash's dislike for Peter has been replaced with a fanboy love for Spider-man. Osborn destroys all evidence that could ruin his name, and Toomes is put in jail. Toomes is visited by Osborn and says it's only a matter of time before the public realizes what Osborn really is and he ends up in prison with Toomes. Osborn responds by saying that perhaps one day he can find it in his heart to forgive Toomes, and maybe, just maybe, he'll allow him to work for him again.
* Peter learns Midtown High is holding a second Homecoming Dance, thanks to the donation of an anonymous benefactor. Peter is tired and decides he wants nothing to do with it, especially after blowing his chances with Liz. Aunt May reveals she's already arranged a date for him to go with, someone she's been trying to set him up with for the entire film. Mary Jane is waiting at the door with her famous ""Face it Tiger, you just hit the the jackpot.""
* Peter freaks out when Aunt May reveals Stark stopped by to drop off ""a new suit"", only to realize it's a suit for the dance with a note that reads ""Go get 'em.""
* Peter arrives at the new Homecoming dance with Mary Jane to find that this time around, the dance's theme is Spider-Man. 

*** 

* The midcredits scene is Osborn rewatching video footage of Peter Parker getting bitten by the spider during a field trip to Oscorp. He has been tracking Peter's progress during all of this time.

***

**Update from original poster**

In response to Toomes' characterization:

&gt;The rewrites are apparently taking Toomes and making him more pitiful than sympathetic. He suggests the off the books early human testing to Osborn as opposed to being against them, and then threatens to blackmail him for $$$/more control of the company. Osborn essentially teaches him not to bite the hand that feeds. He's around his mid-60's and has sort of alienated himself from his daughter/family by burying himself in his work/money, leading to a sort of sad old man who doesn't have anything except for his ""legacy"". When Osborn takes away his legacy, Toomes realizes he has alienated himself from his family, and tries to take it all away from Osborn in the end.

In response to the question: ""Whats Peters character arc in your little script synopsis""

&gt;Peter mirrors Toomes and buries himself in his school work/adult responsibilities. While Toomes buries himself in work and money from a place of selfishness, Peter does it from a place of responsibility. Unlike Toomes however, Peter learns to let people in and get out of his shell a little throughout the movie. He basically learns you can work now and play later, and it doesn't have to be work, work, work

Michael Keaton’s Toomes has arrived with his boys to begin the clean-up process, a nice little contract he’s picked up for his salvage business, only to be stopped by the Department of Damage Control (a nod to the classic Marvel comic series) who are taking over the clean up and send Toomes away. Following that, and the Sony and Marvel logos, things will jump into the middle of Civil War, just after Tony Stark has recruited Peter to his side of the fight. A montage will show Peter’s exploits in leaving New York, riding on a private jet to Germany, and taking place in the big airport fight. We’ll also see what he did right after that, hanging around in Europe… literally, as he explores the world in his brand-new Spider-Man suit.”","6g1apm",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

He was refering obviously to superheroes, advanced technology..etc.


Then i looked back and realized: Marvel villians until now.. Haven't really had costumes or gimmicks special to them.

But now de have these weirdos who brought alien tech and parade un their flashy outfits, do maybe criminals will now use that against them , be as theatrical as them, use the new toys they brought.

This could mean Marvel villians could have a stronger identity to them, and that makes me happy.","5he21q",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

I know it's not going to happen as of yet, and I know the logistics are horrible, but the context in which he appears is actually pretty perfect if you think about it. 

Fisk's currently in prison, but he's pulling all the strings. He's probably organising crime right across NYC, and Matt Murdock knows he's in too deep to be able do much about it right now. 

From this position, Fisk/Kingpin could get involved in any crime element of the Spider-Man: Homecoming plot. Come up with whatever story for him in the film you like; I'm not trying to pitch a plot to you. 

What I'm trying to say is - right now, Kingpin is in the *perfect* place for a movie cameo. He can appear, he can do whatever bad stuff he wants from within prison, and it wouldn't need to be addressed in Daredevil **at all**. It could just be another one of the corrupt things that Kingpin gets away with from within prison - generally irrelevant to the plot of Daredevil, but potentially relevant to the plot of Homecoming. 

One of the primary concerns is how disparate the writings processes behind the movies and TV are and how hard it is to actually link the two together. Half of the problem has already been solved with Fisk being in prison though - the other half is getting him in to Homecoming.

"423",1485152260,"marvelstudios","sirdiddlysquat","self.marvelstudios",4,102,NA,NA,"GUESS: Abraham Attah is playing a Wakandan exchange student in Spider-Man: Homecoming","Save for a [single post](http://forums.superherohype.com/showthread.php?t=517237) from superherohype, I haven't found any other posts that covered this topic - sorry if it has actually been discussed before!

I was talking to a friend about *Black Panther*, and as we approached the topic of the rumored flashbacks in which T'Challa attends an American high school, it occurred to me that Abraham Attah could be playing a Wakandan foreign exchange student in *Spider-Man: Homecoming.*  

This came to mind because of Attah's Ghanaian background (though Ghana is in West Africa, as opposed to Wakanda's more east positioning) and the fact that he's likely playing one of Peter Parker's classmates.  I think this is him in the [int. trailer](https://youtu.be/41dUp3kK-0w?t=1m21s), wearing a yellow jacket that the Midtown High School of Science and Technology probably wears for its math/science team.
     
While Tom Holland and Tony Revolori are 20 year olds playing 16 year olds, I think it's possible for the 15 year old Attah to play an 11-13 year old who, because of his Wakandan higher education, skipped straight to attending what is probably one of the best American high schools in the MCU. 

I attribute the latter assumption to Midtown High's ""upgrade"" to being a school of science and technology (and rumors of Flash Thompson being a sort of academic rival to Peter), as well as Tom Holland visiting Bronx Science - one of NYC's specialized high schools, some of which have been ranked among the best in the nation.  (I even had an [old post theorizing Midtown High being a fictional version of one of these schools](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/4p6wkn/midtown_school_of_science_and_technology_might_be/))


**TL;DR** - Abraham Attah could be playing a Wakandan foreign exchange student attending Peter's math and science school.  Since the Ghanaian actor is a couple of years younger than the other high school actors, he could even play someone who skipped a couple of grades because he's so smart - maybe because of his background in a super technologically advanced nation.","5pmu5y",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

Talking mostly about Donald Glover, Martin Starr, Hannibal Buress, Logan Marshall-Green, maybe Michael Mando, etc.

Basically, Peter will be split between two storylines: high school life, and his time in Stark's brand new think tank, with other NYC-based grant recipients from Civil War. This will be a way of breaking up the tone of the film: while the high school storylines are mired in hormones and drama, the think tank will be sarcastic, quippy and clever. Peter is much happier at the think tank; he's too awkward and smart to fit in at school. However, over time, he realizes he's also too young for the think tank, and feels like he just doesn't seem to belong anywhere.

Other theory: Michael Keaton / Adrian Toomes will *also* be among the think tank, someone who went back to school later in life. Unlike Peter, he's too old for this group, and maybe not quite smart / innovative enough. He becomes more and more resentful. He starts working with another student (Marshall-Green is rumored to play the Tinkerer) to build a wingsuit, and villainous hijinks ensue. Tony mocks him for being unoriginal: ""You know we already have one of those, right? Just build a suit of armor: if you're ripping someone off, rip off the best.""

If this happens, I hope Marvel doesn't give Glover / Buress / Starr / Mando / etc. original character names. Marvel must have hundreds of old scientist characters that will never ever make it to the MCU. There's no reason Buress couldn't be named something like [Abner Croit](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Abner_Croit_\(Earth-616\)).","4ph63d",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

"525",1481144148,"marvelstudios","HighTreazon","self.marvelstudios",50,74,74,0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming, The Sokovia Accords, and the greater MCU","What bothered me most about *Captain America: Civil War* was that Tony Stark's recruitment of Peter Parker seemed like a huge act of hypocrisy. Obviously Peter Parker is one of the few MCU heroes who has a secret identity that MUST be maintained. Therefore, there is no way that he signed the Sokovia Accords (forfeiting his privacy) before Tony brought him to Germany.  
For Tony to secretly recruit a powered individual (much less a minor), and then deploy that individual overseas in a destructive and very publicized ""fiasco"" of a conflict, all to *enforce* the Sokovia Accords against those who refused to sign, without having said recruited individual sign himself is completely hypocritical. That being said, I don't take issue with this story choice wholesale, in fact, I think that it fits Tony's character and leaves room for important character developments.  

I just think that this needs to be addressed in subsequent films. Obviously Tony will be taking on a mentor-like role for Peter going forward, as they have a lot in common from a surface level (genius orphans). However I think that Peter and Tony should have an eventual falling out as Peter comes to terms with how Tony used him, and the inherent hypocrisy.  
A lot of people have expressed concern that Tony Stark is influencing MCU Spider-Man too much and not letting him be his own hero. I think that the initial set up of Peter being completely in awe of and willing to follow Tony is both realistic, and appropriate. However it seems like the best way to develop their relationship is for Peter to realize he needs to be his own person, especially in light of Tony's manipulations. I also think that Peter's eventual rejection of Tony's patron-ship can be equally important for Tony causing him to look inward.  
As we saw in Iron Man 3, Tony's daddy-issues give him the urge to be a mentor and father figure to anyone he sees himself in. With Tony Stark's time in the MCU *possibly* drawing to a close over the next few years, it would be nice to see him reconcile some of these issues.  
In some ways, Peter Parker has more in common with Steve Rogers than Tony Stark when it comes to their central ethos and heart. I think it was nice that they shared that brief moment of acknowledgement in Civil War, despite being opposed in the conflict. There were unsubstantiated rumours that Steve would also appear in Homecoming, and although I find this dubious, I think it can be helpful to think about how they would interact, with Cap currently a fugitive.  
At the end of the day, Spider-Man must align with neither Stark nor Rogers, finding his own moral center, one which others will eventually look to for guidance. 

TLDR; Peter must eventually realize how Tony has used him, and the unethical and hypocritical circumstances of the Sokovia Accords, before going on to become his independent and true self, ""the best out of all of us"".","5h2gyb",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

"550",1492860982,"FanTheories","Kurty12","self.FanTheories",36,68,NA,NA,"Why Sony Is Waiting On Spider-Man: Homecoming To See If They Can Rival Marvel Or DC One Day","Warning: Spoilers Ahead If You're Not Up To Speed On Miles Morales' Origin Story

This may sound crazy to some, but most comic fans out there know that Marvel Comics has enough people with spider powers that this could actually work. All you have to do is look at the sales at Marvel which reflects that some of their best properties are Spider-Man, Spider-Man, Spider-Gwen and that's not even including the ones that still sell pretty well.

The best I can tell: Sony owns all the Spider-people and there's one more factor that this could be part of their plan as well -- Miles Morales' upcoming animated adventure. This is a perfect way to test out if they could have a successful shared universe without Peter Parker...At first!

Let's start at the beginning: If Spider-Man: Homecoming is a huge success then Marvel/Sony has brought faith back to consumers and this should open many doors which were previously closed before. Honestly, why have a Silver Sable movie when you could have the origins of Spider-Gwen, Spider-Woman and the immensely interesting Scarlet Spider that would allowed for a wide range of stories with all of the great villains from Spidey's past.?

One more thing before I get into how they could setup their shared universe: Sony still owns Spider-Man (Peter Parker) and he could drop by at any time with the right story, which the fans would go nuts for, like, maybe a Spider-Verse story against The Inheritors for one! And this is all because Marvel Studios made Spider-Man great again (sorry for those choice of words, but its true!)

1) I would start out with Miles Morales right after Peter's death just like in the Ultimate Comics. Also, Jessica Drew doesn't have to be a clone of Peter, but she still needs to be involved in Miles' life because that relationship in the comics would translate beautifully on the big screen. Also, another potent moment could be when May gives Miles Peter's old web-shooters. Oh yeah, this movie will be extremely emotional!

So, as of now, we have introduced Jessica and Miles and explained why Peter isn't here due to his death by the hands of the Green Goblin. The main villain should be Miles' Uncle Aaron, a.k.a The Prowler, as he tries to get Miles do his dirty deeds. We have yet to see this dynamic play out and this would be a great internal struggle for Miles knowing that uncle is a career criminal, but..Oh yeah, his uncle is the reason he got bit by a spider while visiting his house one day. Good stuff. I could explain a lot more, but you get the gist. Spider- Woman will be with Miles every step of the way, too.

2) Spider-Gwen could easily occupy the same universe as the other two heroes -- I'm not a comic book purist and I believe things should always change in adaptations. Why couldn't Peter, Gwen and Cindy all be bitten that day when they went Osborn Industries. I'll be short with the one; instead of her loving Peter in her world, she could love someone else that gets jealous of powers and turns himself into The Lizard. They could battle all movie and at the end she finds out its person she's in love. Also, they could have cameos from Miles and Jessica to show that this all takes place in the same Universe as they patrol different Burroughs. This could work.

3) Okay, you still could do a Silk, Scarlet Spider, Agent Venom movie and this could all lead to a huge crossover with the Marvel Studios' Spider-Man when they must team-up to stop The Inheritors. This would be so amazing to all the Spidey fans out there.

Lastly, the only problem with this is could audience grow fatigue with all these Spider based powers? I don't think so: As long as they all have different personalities and you have sharp writers and directors then Sony could seriously have a shared universe that could rival Marvel or DC. I say this because Marvel Studios has so many characters that these ones might not have the chance to shine like they deserve. What do you think?

*(PETER and MJ meet HARRY, BETTY, FLASH, and LIZ outside the entrance of Midtown High’s gymnasium.)*

HARRY

Hey Pete! Over here!

FLASH

Well, well, well, Parker actually scored a date! And here I was thinking you were gonna spend the night slow dancing with your microscope!

PETER

Nah, Microscope won’t answer any of my calls. Besides, I wouldn’t want you struggling with it if Liz wanted to dance.

*(MJ giggles. FLASH’s instinct is to lunge forward but, remembering their last fight, he holds back.)*

FLASH

I *would* beat the snot out of you Parker… but it’s Homecoming… it-it’s like a national holiday or something...

LIZ

*(Flustered)* Let’s just go in, I want to see how much of the ice sculpture the new homecoming committee was able to salvage!

HARRY

Um, actually Liz, I’m not sure how well the old ice sculpture will fit in with the new theme our donor requested…

*(The teens open the door to find that the dance is now “Spider-Man” themed. The gym is filled with red, black, and blue colors with plenty of web-like streamers. Spidey symbols are everywhere and the live band is just finishing up a song. PETER looks floored.)*

LIZ

Ugh! Spider-Man!? The color scheme doesn’t go with my dress!

MJ

So cool!

FLASH

C’mon Liz.

*(FLASH, LIZ, HARRY, and BETTY start making their way to the dance floor.)*

LIZ

I want a new homecoming dance!

BETTY

*Another homecoming dance?* No way! I'd get sick of anything done three times!

*(The band starts to play a [familiar song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WQJg5fP0U8))*

PETER

So… you like Spider-Man?

MJ

Are you kidding? I *love* Spider-Man!

*(The bass line comes in. PETER smiles.)*

PETER

… You wanna dance?

MJ

*(Laughing)* What took you so long? Let’s go Tiger!

SINGER

*“Spider-Man, Spider-Man,
Does whatever a spider can.
Spins a web, any size.
Catches thieves just like flies.
Look out! Here comes the Spider-Man!”*

*[MJ and PETER hit the dance floor. LIZ’s aggressive dance instructions have done PETER well (despite never quite being able to dip LIZ right), as he and MJ make a pretty good pair.]*

SINGER

*“Is he strong? Listen bud,
He’s got radioactive blood.
Can he swing from a thread?
Take a look overhead.
Hey there! There goes the Spider-Man!”*

*(FLASH and LIZ, themselves dancing, are distracted by PETER and MJ.)*

FLASH

Ha! Check out Parker over there with Insaney Janey!

LIZ

Ouch! You’re on my foot again Flash!... what is this?!

*(LIZ interrupts their dance to pull back FLASH’s sleeve, revealing a fresh Spider-Man tattoo on his wrist.)*

FLASH

Gah! Careful! It’s still fresh!

LIZ

*You know these last forever don’t you!?*

FLASH

Well that was the idea Babe!

LIZ

*What will our children think?!*

FLASH

*Children?!*

SINGER

*“In the chill of night,
At the scene of the crime,
Like a streak of light,
He arrives just in time!”*

*(Suddenly, MJ forgoes her and PETER’s impressive choreography to spastically dance like nobody's watching. PETER, happy to finally let loose, joins in with a overly energetic running-man.)*

SINGER

*“Spider-Man, Spider-Man,
Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.
Wealth and fame, he’s ignored.
Action is his reward.
Look out. (Look out!) Here comes the Spider-Man!”*

*(Cut to J. JONAH JAMESON coming home after a long day. His very young son, JOHN JAMESON, is coloring in the kitchen and happily shows his father a freshly drawn picture of Spider-Man. JJJ rolls his eyes and puts the picture up on the fridge to join a gallery of rocket ship drawings. He then sighs and gives his son a dollar.)*

*(Cut back to the dance, where PETER and MJ are now laughing as they do a two man can-can. HARRY and BETTY watch from their own dance.)*

BETTY

I think your friend’s a little weird.

HARRY

*(Smiling)* I know he is. Wouldn’t have him any other way.

SINGER

*“Spider-Man, Spider-Man,
Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.
Wealth and fame, he’s ignored.
Action is his reward.
Look out. (Look out!) Here comes the Spider-Man!
In the chill of night…”*

*(Cut to TONY STARK, who is in his lab admiring the inverter that PETER was able to fix. Inspired, he decides not to give up on fixing something of his own and places a video call to PEPPER POTTS. We see TONY smile as the call is answered.)*

SINGER

*“At the scene of the crime…”*

*(Quick cut to PETER and MJ now doing the Pulp Fiction dance.)*

SINGER

*""Like a streak of light,
He arrives just in time!”*

*(Cut to TOOMES in jail getting a visit from his daughter, VALERIA. We see him tearfully apologizing as he puts his hand on the glass.)*

SINGER

*“Spider-Man! Spider-Man!”*

*(VALERIA, who sees that she can start to build a relationship with her father without the distraction of work or vengeance, places her hand on the glass as well and gives him a look of forgiveness.)*

SINGER

*“Does whatever a Spider can!”*

*(Quick cut of PETER and MJ grabbing hands and spinning around in a circle.)*

SINGER

*“Spins a web, any size!
Catches thieves just like flies!
Look out! Here comes the Spider-Man!”*

*(Cut to AUNT MAY walking through her apartment. She passes by some family portraits and lovingly kisses her hand in order to plaster it on a photo of UNCLE BEN.)*

SINGER

*“Spider-Man! Spider-Man!
Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man!
Wealth and fame, he’s ignored!
Action is his reward!”*

*(Cut back to the gym where PETER and MJ have now ruined homecoming with their odd dancing. Every student in the school has now backed away from them to watch and mock them, but they couldn’t care less as they laugh and continue dancing.)*

SINGER

*“Look out! (Look out!)”*

*(Suddenly, MJ loses her footing and starts to fall backward. PETER, in his most graceful move of the night, acts fast and is able to catch her in a dip. The two look at each other and as the worry fades away, they smile.)*

SINGER

*“Here comes the Spider-Man!”*

*(The shot zooms out as the students continue to stare at the two laughing teenagers, then continues outside the gym and up to the school flagpole where the flag is now joined by a few threads of webbing from the previous fight. The song ends.)*","4l8eh4",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

"690",1467338889,"marvelstudios","SamtheSpider","self.marvelstudios",23,45,45,0,"Who I think Abraham Attah is REALLY playing in Spider-Man: Homecoming (Spoiler Alert: It's NOT MILES MORALES)","So I'm a mixed black guy, right? (Really weird way to start off this post. I'm sorry, just bear with me.) Now, while I really appreciate all the love that half-Black, half-Hispanic Spider-Man, Miles Morales, gets these days in social media and etc, I have something I'd really love to discuss with my favorite Marvel family.

Miles is a great, if not excellent character. I mean this as a fan of his character and of another certain walloping-websnapper, that happens to be quite amazing as well. (I like Peter just a hair better than Miles, but it is oh-so-close.) Something that really bugs me though, is that most of the desire to see Miles, at least that I have noticed, comes from the plain wish to push him into the MCU, because he's Black/a minority. 

Now, I can't speak for every person of color. (I'm definitely not qualified.) However, this really bothers me, especially that a large part of Miles character (the part that I love and relate to) is his desire to live up to the expectations he's placed on himself of what he expects Peter would have done. Let's face it. We've all looked up to someone and wondered how we would have performed in their situations and choices. This bring me to my main point, or half-way there at least.

MILES MORALES SHOULD NOT BE IN SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING OR ITS SEQUEL.

If such a large part of his character motivations and his devotion to being Spidey isn't applicable in the MCU, and won't be for at least a few years, what is the point of having him there? Even if he doesn't get his powers for a while, having Miles be even a semi-regular character in this franchise, at this point, will strip the emotional weight from his character. It has to be earned.

Look, I could talk about Miles all day, and don't even get me started on Pete, but I realized I haven't even said who I think Abraham Attah should play. XD

Anyways, I believe that instead of Miles, Abraham should play Uatu. 
Now, before you kill me, the character I am talking about is not The WATCHER, but instead a small, young, extremely intelligent boy named after him instead. Exhibit A: http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/0/08/Uatu_Jackson_(Earth-616)_from_Amazing_Spider-Man_Vol_4_1_001.png/revision/latest?cb=20151014194942

In case you're not familiar with the character (Wouldn't blame you) he was a coworker of Peter Parker at Horizon Labs, which was an incredibly intelligent think tank of scientists in Marvel Comics, and in fact helped both Peter, Doc Ock in Pete's body, and a superhero/superheroine (not politically correct enough?) named The Wraith take down supervillains with his tech. 

Now, you might be thinking, why would this random kid be a good fit for this actor? Well, for starters, I believe Abraham Attah would be a great choice for this character since he is excellent at portraying a kid with deep layers. His performance from Beasts of No Nation more than proves that.

Also, as we've seen from the set pics, it would appear that he hangs out with the ""geek squad"" of Peter's peers just from the way those certain actors seem to stay with each other on set, and from recent rumors. 
Exhibit B: http://i1228.photobucket.com/albums/ee448/Kindanfruitso/lIisJNv_zps4dlpvgah.jpg

All that would need to be done is to make him a small, timid, maybe even foreign kid (I believe Abraham Attah is from Ghana, and it would explain the name Uatu), and he'd fit right in Peter's band of friends in the MCU.

I have a few other reasons I'd love to see this character, but this post is probably long enough as it is! :D Hope I haven't offended anyone with my whole position on Miles in the MCU, but I really just want them to do him right and I don't think that will be achieved if he's in this movie. 

Love you guys (And this freaking sub), so please let me know if this is dumb or brilliant in the comments!

P.S. It would be EXCELLENT if they simply hinted at him with perhaps his uncle, the Prowler, showing up? Played by a Mr. Donald Glover, perhaps? :D","4qpcnl",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

I didn't even open the article or look for Spider-Man news, as I'm trying really hard to go in blind. 

I thought Avengers 2 was information overload, but boy was I wrong. Does anyone else agree? ","6l88g0",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

Despicable Me 2 earned $970 million and Minions $1.159 billion. It may not reach Minions' heights but the floor for DM3 is at least $900 million. 81% on Rotten Tomatoes is pretty good, so it won't have toxic word-of-mouth among family audiences.  

Even worst case Spider-Man will make as much as TASM which earned $757 million. Spider-Man 3 is the high water mark with $890 million but after 10 years, 3 ill-recieved movies, and 2 reboots, the franchise has gone downhill each time out. However this is another pseudo Iron Man movie so maybe it has billion dollar potential?  

It is a safe bet that neither of these movies will overtake Guardians of the Galaxy 2 or Wonder Woman domestic totals both finishing over $380 million.  

Ultimately I'm picking Despicable Me 3 to win the summer with $1-1.1 billion and Spider-Man coming in second with $900 million.","6jsuw2",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

~~My own impressions are in the comments.~~

Edit: So I thought it was classier to put your views in a comment, like in an AskReddit, so that it is a level playing field discussion. Automod thought the post was too short, so here is my take on 'IronMan's tele-working Robin - Puberty The Motion Picture' by Disney for Sony. I do not like this rule.

Positives 

-  Great acting by most of the cast
- Holland has a Morty from 'Rick and Morty' quality, very believable 15 yr old American.
- Decent believable and partially relatable villain in the form of Birdman. This is something MCU films are weak at. The villain may be well cast, good character design but they are either crypto-Nazis, social Darwinists or solely power crazy. Wonder Woman and Man of Steel had these problems too. 
- Less likely to spot the outline of Hollands dick in the costume, when compare to Garfield in the previous films. He's nearly like Action Man in this one.
- Less 'time to feel sorry for Spider-Man' in this than in the original trilogy.

Negative &amp; Positive:
This Sony film produced by Marvel is the most Disney MCU film to date. More so than Ant Man, which had a real family feel - divorced dad &amp; kid relationship at the forefront. This is specifically about highschool in a way that Amazing Spiderman 1 &amp; 2 were not (those had a 30 yr old playing a highschool but he felt like a college student). That is why I was bored at times during Homecoming - it was a well made movie, but for highschoolers.

CGI spiderman in stunts is obvious, yet not badly done.

Negatives:

- Actress playing love interest is likeable and attractive, but only acting performance that I found mediocre.
- Speaking of love interest, when Spiderman has to duck out at the prom or whatever, they missed the chance for him to use the excuse: 'I've been exposed to bad influences on reddit, and now I'm joining the alt-right.'
- The ending with Iron Man was badly written, like something Downey came up with to 'save the film'. Maybe that is just how I feel about RDj, but it had this nervous 'we are winging it' vibe and made little sense.
- Aunt May is visibly aged compared with Civil War. She is now more plausible casting, but kind of clashed with lines about how hot she was. 
- plot points of Happy ignoring Spider-Man was a forced mechanism to make Spider-Man have to solve things without help. You would think IronMan would be all over shit when he saw the Birdman (yeah, I'm sticking with that) on the ferry. Priority: You know, tidy shit up and arrest the dude, rather than ground the 15 year old. 
- Probably doesn't do justice to Spider-Man the inventor.

Also, Iron Man has a pretty large role in the film. Every movie with Iron Man has an opening weekend over $100 million and $300 million domestic total and the last four movies with Iron Man have all made over $1.1 billion a piece.

Tom Holland is incredible as both Peter Parker and Spidey, and I think the movie does a wonderful job at balancing high school with heroics. IMO the movie has a heavy emphasis on Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man rather than him already being a professional hero, which is great because we get to see him grow as he trains more and more. The supporting characters were great and Michael Keaton was very menacing as Vulture. His intentions felt grounded and justified which was a nice change up from the other villains we've seen in the MCU. All in all it was a breath of fresh air, and I can't wait to see it in theaters again. ","6k5sq3",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

Say you've been given the ability to pitch ideas from Kevin Feigie to give some ideas on what to do with the story and villain. What would you do?
 
I was rewatching the Raimi Spidey series from 1 to 2 (it's a shame they never made a 3rd movie). Goblin and Ock were great. And I noticed that they were great because they were just as important to the film's story as was Peter Parker/Spider-Man. The film was focused both on the hero and the bad guy, while still clearly keeping Spidey as the main character, hence the title of the movie. 
 
Marvel Studios, on the other hand, seems to focus solely on the hero and his journey. The villain is just another obstacle in the hero's way. 
 
This is what I fear for the next Spider-Man movie. What would you do to change that with the Vulture and make him great? Other future Marvel villains like Thanos? Mordo?","5m30vl",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

And as you might also know, it is [getting an IMAX release](http://movieweb.com/spider-man-movie-reboot-release-2017-imax/).

However, *Spider-Man: Homecoming* might only get two weeks in IMAX theaters, because of a certain film that is coming out two weeks later on July 21, 2017.

Wait, there's no way that IMAX would willingly decide to forego the profits from an MCU film, let alone a Spider-Man film, right?

Well, the thing is that, that film that's coming out two weeks later is...*Dunkirk*, written and directed by Christopher Nolan.

And if you didn't know, Christopher Nolan and IMAX [have a very special relationship](https://variety.com/2014/film/features/with-interstellar-imax-hits-hollywoods-bigtime-1201341443/). He has used real IMAX film cameras in every single one of his film's since 2008 (aside from *Inception*) and in turn, IMAX supports him unconditionally.

For example, in 2014, IMAX decided to not screen *The Hunger Games: Mockingjay*, to keep playing Nolan's *Interstellar* as a [sign of loyalty](http://www.thewrap.com/imax-skips-hunger-games-mockingjay-to-stay-with-interstellar/).

And it looks like that trend will continue with *Dunkirk*, with Nolan once again using IMAX film cameras--which he probably wouldn't be using (notoriously loud, heavy, and only able to film for a few minutes at a time) if he wasn't absolutely sure it would get a wide IMAX release.

Of course, if you compare *Catching Fire* and *Mockingjay*'s [box office grosses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_%28film_series%29#Box_office_performance), you could make the argument that *The Hunger Games* (and the young adult dystopia genre in general) was dying out, and so just because IMAX decided to avoid that sinking ship doesn't mean it would do the same to Spider-Man, a popularity giant.

But keep in mind, it's not like IMAX is shutting out *Spider-Man: Homecoming* completely. An IMAX release has already been officially confirmed, and Spider-Man will in all probability make an absolute killing in the two weeks that it has. It's just that its run will be a tiny bit shorter than usual, because of IMAX's relationship with Nolan.

Granted, this theory is based on what little has been established about Spider-Man's story in the MCU and the MCU in general.

Now I think we can all agree that the ""homecoming"" part of the title has multiple meanings. Yes, it means that it should involve Peter Parker's high school homecoming dance. Yes, it has the meta meaning of Spider-Man having his own film in the MCU. But I think it could also have a third meaning: Peter's going to reunite with his parents. Or, at the very least, it will be implied that they are still alive.

My main evidence for this theory doesn't exactly come from the MCU, but rather the show *Agents of SHIELD*. In the comics, as far as I'm aware, it was not only revealed that Peter's parents were still alive, but that they were agents of SHIELD and faked their deaths (I think..again, I'm not too familiar with the comics). I don't see any reason the MCU won't utilize this. Now, I haven't seen *Agents of SHIELD*, but I think its prominence makes the appearance of Peter's parents in the MCU an inevitability. I wouldn't be surprised if they start hinting at it on the show itself.

Again, I know there's not much here in the area of evidence, but there's really not much to work with. Perhaps somebody that's more familiar with *Agents of SHIELD* and/or the comics in general could chime in, but I really think Marvel's gonna make use of this opportunity here.

**TL;DR - Peter Parker's parents are alive and agents of SHIELD in the MCU, and ""homecoming"" partially refers to their return**","4pt2gu",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

"906",1463372260,"marvelstudios","monkiddo","self.marvelstudios",27,22,22,0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming visuals discussion.","So I wanted to see what other people were hoping for with the visuals in Spider-Man: Homecoming. They're embracing the comic book imagery more so then any previous spider-man with the changing eyes, the suit closer resembling the books, and the spider-light. I'm glad to see this. 

[I'd love to see some sort of visual adaption of the classic spider sense imagry](http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/696/asm12-12.jpg). I love what they did in 2002. The Amazing series wasn't as creative. I think a good way would be to take a [que from the 90s animated series.](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelanimated/images/5/5c/SpideySensePeter.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080419172713) Invert the colors behind him and dolly zoom would be good.  In Civil War there was no effect which is fine, but I'm hoping there is something more cinematic that embraces the comic visuals more. I feel there will be. [Ant-Man has the echo outlines like in the comics.](https://i.imgur.com/vyZyWit.gif)

As bad as the Green Hornet movie is (and it's pretty bad) they did some really [great visuals with Kato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFqitPr_Gpg&amp;t=0m15s). Despite him not having any kind of super senses that's a pretty cool representation of super senses. It seems like Peter needs his goggles otherwise sense over load is a problem. If he gets in a fight without his goggles or mask it could be a bit closer to this.

I really want the camera to be perpendicular to the surface he's crawling on. I think that's a great visual concept that has never been utilized enough in Spider-Man films.

[Not perpendicular with subject](http://www.awn.com/sites/default/files/styles/inline/public/image/featured/51620-spider-man-s-lizard-part-2-digital-effects.jpg?itok=qdkHTXe7)

[Perpendicular with subject.](http://i.imgur.com/HUVwjI9.jpg)

It make the audience associate with Peter's perception while making the whole world feel slightly disorienting which just adds to the idea that Spider-man has so much to keep up with while moving. 

Also would love some of the [Spider logo being used in universe before attack](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/5/5c/The_Spectacular_Spider-Man_Vol_1_136.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080612161441)

Thor's got those dutch angles, Cap has that shakey cam, Ant-Man uses macro photography. What about you guys? What visuals do you want to see brought in to define this new Spider-Man series? ","4jjkrx",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

My theory is pretty simple. Peter and Tony will play out the Prodigal Son story in which Peter is the son and Tony is the father.

Tony has played the part of Peter's father figure before in the comics, notably during the 2006 civil war arc. This is likely what Marvel has planned for Peter in the MCU as well. They introduced Peter during MCU Civil War through Tony. 

I would also like to point out that Tony makes a lot of ""stereotypical dad-type"" comments towards Peter in the non-sentimental-but-obviously-worried-about-his-safety kind of way. He teases his equipment a bit in CW then replaces it. When he's disappointed in Peter for being reckless, he takes the suit away.

This taking of the suit is what I perceive as the Son's fall. He'll then do his Disney thing and he and Tony will be best buds again.

It's not much of a theory, but I still think it's accurate.

IDK if it's intentional though. I could expect a sarcastic 'prodigal son' comment in the movie though.","6203v3",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

"999",1499289896,"movies","DanGrima92","self.movies",67,17,NA,NA,"Spider-Man: Homecoming is easily my new favourite Spider-Man film","I just got out of Spider-Man: Homecoming and absolutely loved it.

Tom Holland is excellent once again as Peter Parker and the film focuses just as much as him being a high school kid as it does on him being Spider-Man. That may sound like a bad thing but the high school stuff works this time round and is actually genuinely funny. 

I also loved the way they showed Peter learning and growing as a superhero. Rather than just having a montage of him webbing criminals up, they show him messing up constantly as he tries so hard to impress people, particularly Tony Stark (RDJ gets a few scenes but it never feels like he overshadows Spidey)

As for the villain, I was quite impressed. Its no secret that Marvel has a bit of a villain problem but I enjoyed Michael Keaton as Vulture. He doesn't have some ridiculous grand plan to kill everyone. He's a pretty regular guy who just happens to have a high tech wing suit to help him steal stuff and Keaton pulls it off.

My only slight complaints are that I feel the second act of the film is a little over reliant on his suits abilities and the final fight is a little anti climatic (though still very entertaining)

I may have described this movie pretty badly but overall I thought Spider-Man: Homecoming was well worth the watch and hopefully we get to watch this Spidey for a long time. 9/10","6lh3m7",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

You could have Peter, Michelle, Ned, Liz, and Flash doing the iconic dance scene from near the end of The Breakfast Club, as well as doing the ""hallway slide / scramble"" when the kids are racing back to the classroom, for example, with it all set to a fun '80s song. Maybe even throw in stuff like the museum montage from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. 

I thought that would be a really fun and clever way to send off the movie, but I'm sure Marvel Studios will have something even better in store. ","6cf4yn",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

Back in '02 when I was a kid, all I had was the web-shooter spray and the mask. But with Homecoming, kids growing up today get all the kid extra gadgets from the comic books that never made it to the big screen before such as: the WEB WINGS (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTFT8Oc44Tc)

And before anyone says, ""OH WHAT CRAP TOYS"" - Let's remember this is for kids. If I was a kid, I'd definitely want the Web Wings so I can pretend to fly as Spidey. And the fact that the eyes can open and close just like the movie is awesome too!

However, one thing I will say is that it seems a lot of gadgets featured in Homecoming almost seem like they're there to sell toys (There's even the 89.99 Homecoming Spidey Camera Drone), but I understand it fits the Iron Man mentor story. 

Besides, it's still awesome to think that the web wings from the comics have finally made it to the big screen and serve a purpose. I always wanted to see them be used as wings in the movies and never thought it was possible until now. Thanks, Marvel/Sony!!! Also, gotta' love the '90s feel of the commercial.","6elywo",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

If you read the tracklist of Homecoming, you would notice a track called ""No Frills ProtoCOOL"". So, my guess is after Peter realises that with all the extra gadgets in his suit, all that has happened is that he has lost all the battles, but he defeated the Vulture (duh) in his homemade suit, he will activate the Training Wheels protocol on the suit again.","6h0qox",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

If such a soundtrack were to exist, I want the soundtrack to be something Peter would curate a playlist for himself. It's clear Peter Parker could be an Indiehead as Alt-J's Left Hand Free was played during his introduction ""QUEENS"" scene. But I also like to think Peter is also a Hip-hop head. He lives in Queens where it's a racially diverse area so to not him be a hip hop head considering the area he lives in and at an age where a lot of teenagers like him are fans of hip hop would be weird to me.

So, let's talk about artists we want to be involved in this Spider-Man soundtrack. Discuss!","4ou4pj",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

This is on top of bad posters, at least one bad trailer depending on who you ask, and that Tom Holland is doing his late interview runs with Robert Doweny JR. Spider-Man never needed Iron Man to sell a film before so why now?

When TASM first came out in theaters back in 2012, all three Raimi films were separately re-released on blu-ray. 

Then, when TASM2 came out in 2014 - Sony decided to release the entire Spider-Man Trilogy Collection on blu-ray (along with Spectacular Spider-Man: Complete Series, which was cool). I know this is a typical business practice to hype up a new release and also take advantage of the new release.

But does anyone think we'll see some kind of re-release (possibly director's cuts)? I'm sure we won't because Sony might want to make fans forget about these past two movies, which many deem as failures. Still, I think it'd be nice to see the INTENDED versions of Webb's movies rather than the watered down theatrical ones.

This one's definitely not happening, but there's also the prospect of a Spider-Man 3.1 (which I don't care about as much as the obviously imcomplete TASM films). I'm ready for all the ""Hell no"" answers and the ""Spidey MCU is all we need. Let's move on from the past"". Also, if anything - We'll most likely get NO RE-RELEASES or RE-RELEASES, BUT THE SAME THING AND NOTHING ADDED.","579jq7",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

A 15 year old would have been 10 in 2012, and 6 in 2008.  A 13 year old would have been 8 and 4.  A 10 year old would have been 5 and 1.

Spider-Man: Homecoming takes the POV of a 16 year-old character and seems to explain who the Avengers are to an audience that is aware of them, but may not remember having experienced their journey.

Captain who?  Iron what?  Chitauri huh?

This is my impression.  Do you agree?  It seems that Marvel wants to use Spider-Man to carry Marvel into and through its next phases, replacing Iron Man.  As a result, I feel as if they're reaching out to an audience to whom the Marvel movies themselves are an entirely new phenomenon.

Spider-Man: Homecoming will be the first marvel movie for an entire generation.  The Avengers, therefore, are ancient history.

Makes you feel old huh?","6jubic",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

This instantly reminded me of how Amazing Spider-Man #2 featured the Vulture and Tinkerer in the *same issue.*

Since Marvel can't do the Fantastic Four story from ASM #1, I have a feeling they might be choosing Vulture since he was Spider-Man's second villain. This excites me to no end that they made this choice.

Although, I'm not sure whether it's entirely coincidence or not.","61igg4",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

I know the timeline of the movie is probably post-Uncle Ben. But even though he is a narratively brief character in terms of lore he is the *most* important character in Parker's life.


Even decades of comics passed and he still was a driving force in Parker's life.


I know comic-fans kinda have to make sacrifices to the MCU, sometimes. But i really would hate to lose this dynamic of Peter's personality.","5bebr6",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

&gt; Marvel Studios won’t pay Sony Pictures for the rights to put Spider-Man in “Captain America: Civil War,” the “Avengers” franchise or its other superhero films, as part of its new partnership with the studio, according to sources with knowledge of the deal. At the same time, Marvel won’t receive a cut of the box office for any of Sony’s films that feature Spider-Man. Sony won’t receive a percentage of the revenue Disney makes from Marvel’s films that have Spider-Man, either.

So Sony doesn't get a cut of Civil War or Avengers. So did Sony pay for Homecoming with no creative input? Will Marvel only profit from merchandising? This whole deal confuses me.

Alternatively, since Sony technically still owns Spider-Man, can they put him in the Venom movie (or other future spin-offs) if they want?","6hfihg",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

The problem is that (with the exception of Raimi's Spider-Man 2), the story never quite lives up to the visuals. What I want with Homecoming is the visuals to not necessarily be shelved in favor of the story, I just want the story to have received as much thought and effort as the visuals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Week 01 - Spider Problem**

Things are going great for Peter Parker...until they aren't. After being relentlessly mocked in the super-villain community for being ""basically just a weird dude that dressed in a bird costume (but not in a cool way, like Falcon)"", Spider-Man's enemy, Vulture, decided he has had enough! He has taken the mantle that once belonged to Doc Oc and made his own Sinister Six, hellbent on capturing his greatest foe, Spider-Man.  With the aid of Rhino, Kraven the Hunter, Hobgoblin, a man calling himself 'Kaine' and one going by the name of Spidercide, they put the Academy under siege, at least until they deliver to them the head of the one that calls himself ""Peter Parker"", in exchange for the life of the other they call...Aunt May. Kaine and Spidercide seem to have a particular interest in Peter, even going as far as dress similarly to him...

To beat the invasion and help his Aunt May, Peter needs to assemble the greatest team of Spiders this multiverse has ever seen. The first candidate? Cindy Moon, Peter Parker's former classmate, who had seemily gone off-grid for a while. Apparently she was bitten by the same radioactive spider, and now calls herself Silk!

It turns out there *was* a reason Spidercide and Kaine had beef with Spider-Man - according to Vulture, one of the three of them may be the *real* Peter Parker, while the other two are clones! Created from Peter's genetic material with the meddling of Doc Oc and Green Goblin, the spider-clones are everywhere. By infiltrating the Vulture's lair, the manage to find another one: he goes by Ben Reilly, or Scarlet Spider, and though amnestic, he might as well be the original Peter Parker!

My issue with Flash being an intellectual rival to Peter rather than a physical one is that sort of isn't the purpose of the character in my eyes. Flash's character was always interesting to me since he really didn't intimidate Peter physically after he became Spider-Man but it showed how hard Peter has to try to keep his identity hidden by pretending Flash can still kick his ass. Flash also is often shown to be a huge Spider-Man fan which made that whole situation ironic. Peter no longer secretly has the upper hand in this scenario so their relationship can't display his self control.

As for Zendaya's character, recent news has said she's rumored to be playing Mary Jane yet the description given for her character is ""very smart, very intellectual, [and] always in her books."". That doesn't sound like MJ, that sounds just like Gwen Stacy, so why not just make her Gwen Stacy? The photos of her on set also seem to reinforce that idea. 

I'm just a bit irritated these characters are being given the names of classic Spider-Man characters, but it seems their only relation so far to them is Flash is Peter's rival and MJ is Peter's love interest. ","4yfodw",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

The film is a perfect blend of heroics and high school that collects all the best pieces of Peter Parker and assembles them into this amazing, spectacular film that is Spider-Man: Homecoming.

The cast is just fantastic across the board with little to complain about. Tom Holland is the definitive versions of both sides of the historic comic character. Few embody both the alter ego and the mask with such ease as the young star does here. Michael Keaton is also fairly menacing as the Vulture and all of Peter’s classmates get a moment to shine.


Without a doubt Spider-Man: Homecoming is can’t miss entertainment for a summer that’s been largely disappointing. For more of my thoughts visit 614NOW or check out some of my other reviews. Share, subscribe, comment below and as always return to I Am Sam for weekly reviews and insight.

In a statement issued from the James Brady Press Room in the White House, Joshua Earnest, White House Press Secretary to the President, said of the historic executive action, ""The president wishes to extend an inclusive hand to the city of Detroit while injecting the city with a large stimulus of Hollywood money.""

Earnest continued his extended remarks saying, ""At this moment, Disney has more money than the government so we feel confident they will be able to accommodate the large casting list.""

Senate Republicans were quick to criticize the decision with Louie Gomert (R-TX) issuing a Tweet storm lashing out at the perceived waste and distraction from issues considered important.

&gt;RADICALISLAMRADICALISLAMRADICALISLAMOBAMAOBAMARADICALISLAM

&gt;@bigfreedommoneylouie

Jon Watts, the newly minted blockbuster director taking on his first expanded studio venture, issued an enthusiastic statement about the casting action made by the president.

""Gee, gosh. I mean wow. I'm actually so relived. We cast the entire city of New York but we've still got like 400,000 speaking parts left to cast and I was afraid we wouldn't be able to fill them cause some of these guys don't speak English and I didn't want to cast international. But now we can film in Detroit for pennies. It'll be great for the part where I destroy the city an then end on this sweet musical number I'm writing."" Watts said 

Paul Ryan, Senate leader, was seen inside the Senate gym working out when he saw the news on CNN. As of press time, he's doing curls in front of a mirror whispering, ""oh yeah I'm an ideas guy. I'm the ideas guy. Look at the swole ideas. UuuuuuuwwwwwwAaaaaaahhhhhhh.""

Presumptive Republican nominee Donald J. Trump in a stunning move praised the decision by Mr. Obama commenting that this was a huge accomplishment.

""This is tremendous. It's huge. I was concerned I had to carry this entire movie my self. I don't need congratulations for getting this movie so right. This will go far in making my time tremendous performance look humongous, bigly.""

At press time Mr. Trump was seen slapping his micropenis watching clips of women opening Spam on the internet cooing to himself, ""that's meeeeeeee. Thaaaaaaaatssss meeeeee biglyyyyyy.""","4pi2sq",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

*****
&gt; Comic-book castings are usually treated as a big deal, but when Zendaya inked a contract to star as the female lead in next summer&amp;#039;s Spider-Man: Homecoming, Sony and Marvel Studios were unusually quiet about who she&amp;#039;d be playing.

&gt; At a later Comic-Con press opportunity, Zendaya and Spider-Man: Homecoming director Jon Watts revealed that she would be playing someone named Michelle, but fans could still sense some obfuscation.

&gt; As per The Wrap, Zendaya is actually playing Mary Jane Watson, Peter Parker&amp;#039;s best-known love interest and one brought to the big screen by Kirsten Dunst in the first three Spider-Man films.

&gt; According to Vulture&amp;#039;s own sources, Michelle&amp;#039;s real identity was a twist meant to be confirmed near the end of the film when she would finally invite Peter to call her &amp;quot;M.J.,&amp;quot; but a character reveal of this magnitude is a tricky thing to keep secret these days.

&gt; We&amp;#039;ll see how Watts and Marvel Studios handle the early leak, but it&amp;#039;s worth noting that this is perhaps the most iconic role yet that Marvel has race-bent for the big screen, and since Peter spends much of Spider-Man: Homecoming pining for popular girl Liz Allan, both of his potential love interests in the film will be played by actresses of color.

&gt; While many had hoped that this third movie iteration of Spider-Man would feature biracial hero Miles Morales, Marvel Studios is on a streak of casting black women as female leads, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.

This week on Friends and Film, Cooper and Josh broke down the upcoming Sony-Marvel movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming. 

After digging through potential plot and their expectations for the movie, they [discussed](https://soundcloud.com/friends-film/spider-man-homecoming-preview) what could possibly be in the two post-credit scenes in the movie. 

The question I have for everyone is, what do you want out of a Spider-Man: Homecoming post credit scene? 

Would you like to see them find two little plots with Peter's friends to tie up? Or what about setting up the Vemon-Tom Hardy film for next October? Should it just be a Infinity War teaser? Or my personal favorite, set up the villian for Spider-Man: Homecoming's sequel?

Before we get to see Tom Holland face off against Thanos alongside the rest of the Avengers next year, he must go through his own trial which is Spider-Man Homecoming. Where Civil War was Tom Holland’s demo reel, a question remains he can pull a film on his very own?  The answer is yes.

Despite their original action sequences, what every Spider-Man incarnation lacked was getting the sense of how it was to be Peter Parker. Where Tobey was a great Peter Parker, and Garfield was a great Spider-Man, Holland perfectly nails the character of Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Tom Holland gives a beyond amazingly spectacular performance throughout the entire film. This is his first leading role, and he carries it damn near flawlessly where he has proven to be the best Spider-Man to date. What he brings to the table is a take that Garfield or Maguire never mastered, having the mentality of the age the character is supposed to be. In their first Spider-Man movies, you saw these near 30-year-old actors in high school, and immediately you’re taken out of the experience because they looked more like adults and embodied personalities where they even acted like adults.

You don’t get the sense that Peter is a 30-year-old high school student trying to retrieve his GED. Here you have a teenage Peter Parker going through teenage issues. What makes him relatable is not only his personality but also the conflict he goes through. Some of the problems that Peter have in the movie are relatable issues that teenagers have gone through before from longing to fit in to trying to get your priorities straight.

One of the best aspects of this Spider-Man universe is its diverse cast. This is the first film I’ve seen in a long time that dared to take advantage of its casting. Peter’s best friend is Filipino, his crush is mixed, his high school antagonist is Guatemalan, and they all are derived from characters who were all white in appearance. What they do with every character in this is a new take of who they were written to be in the comics. We all know Flash Thompson as a muscular jock who picks on the weak. Out of all the casting, I was most skeptical about Tony Revolori as Flash just based on his appearance. Boy, was I wrong? In this modern day and age, there is more to being a bully than being a jock and Revolori does an excellent job portraying that.

Where every incarnation of Spider-Man focused on Peter in a relationship with either Mary Jane or Gwen Stacy, the best relationship he shares on screen is with his best friend Ned played by Jacob Batalon. They share an onscreen bromance throughout that is more genuine than Peter had with any of his lady friends. He is the only person that knows his secret, and he quickly becomes neutral to it after being ecstatic.  This may be obscure to some, but they have a relationship similar to Miley and Lily from Hannah Montana. The film often takes the Hannah Montana route with its humor as Peter tries to differentiate himself apart from his famous alter-ego with only his best friend knowing. The majority of the film when it's not a Spider-Man film is a buddy comedy where Ned and Peter look out for each other and have each other’s backs when the going gets tough. They have a friendship that is more genuine than Peter and Harry had in the Raimi series. Peter does have a crush on a girl and has a romance thing, but instead of that being the prominent focus, it's only the subplot.","6kt3zu",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

*****
&gt; Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures have released the first official image of Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes, also known as the villainous vulture, in Spider-Man: Homecoming.

&gt; Marvel and Sony have also released some new details about Toomes&amp;#039; history and how he becomes a supervillain.

&gt; When a new government agency led by white-collar superhero Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man, takes the gig over in the wake of the events of Captain America: Civil War, Toomes decides he isn&amp;#039;t going to take it lying down and he becomes what producer Eric Hauserman Carroll describes &amp;quot;Sort of...the dark Tony Stark.""

&gt; The Vulture teams with two other Marvel supervillains making their cinematic debuts, the Shocker and the Tinkerer, to turn some of the alien and advanced tech they&amp;#039;ve acquired through salvage into powerful new weapons to sell to criminals.

&gt; Director John Watts says his take on the Vulture was inspired by partly by John C. Reilly&amp;#039;s character from Guardians of the Galaxy, Rhomann Dey, who provided a more grounded perspective on the events of the film.

&gt; Peter tries to fall back into his normal daily routine - distracted by thoughts of proving himself to be more than just your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man - but when the Vulture emerges as a new villain, everything that Peter holds most important will be threatened.

Maybe they are reallly good friends, i saw in other pages that he might be playing Harry Osbron or Flash Thompson (this last one i find it very unlikely), also read that Tom was actually gay and he was his boyfriend but i think it he was some random guy joking soo, what do you guys think?

At this point, it isn't just an observation made, but an explicitly stated inspiration for the way the film will be approached, and every new bit of information cements this idea. What do the rest of you take from this? Do you love it? Do you hate it? 


Personally, as much as I loathe the idea of it being a ""John Hughes"" movie, high-school as a setting is a great idea if done right. They can play the whole ""kid playing superhero"" idea of Spider-Man that resonates a lot with us, the idea that everything from the way the hero acts to it's very name-sake - Spider-Man - is a clever exploration of a teenage boy's *idea* of a superhero. It can exhibit how Spider-Man is Peter's manifestation of teenage angst, his channeling of disenfranchisement from bullies and the adding stress and pressure of school life. It could be more too. Spider-Man, with the right approach to writing, has the potential to explore the issues of bullying and it's effects - and the channeling of it for positive change - in a much less corny and more effective way than others. 

I don't know, those are just my two cents - what do the folks at /r/spiderman think?","4ucmww",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

The cast is now at around 22 people, and it is now believed that many of these actors and actresses will play minor roles in the film as Peter Parker's friends, classmates, and teachers. This type of cast set-up is very similar to that of the movie **Sixteen Candles**, of which included a large cast of mainly school faculty, students, and characters related in some way to the central character. Kevin Feige has been noted as saying that the films of director John Hughes would heavily influence the coming-of-age theme of ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (even straight out saying that ""'Spider-Man' will be a ‘John Hughes’ movie""  http://variety.com/2015/film/news/spider-man-john-hughes-kevin-feige-1201532872/), and it seems that this ever-growing cast is very indicative of this relation.","4qp4g8",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

I'm guessing we get to see Spider-Man when he first got the powers and when he got Tony's suit, not like an origin story, just like a quick introduction. Then it'll jump to current time, the Homecoming, and at that time, Vulture is back. Well not sure if back, but he seems to have had the powers for as long as peter has been spider-man. They also seem to have some history together, and I guess Vulture beat the shit out of Peter at coney island. But now with a new suit and more confidence, he'll try and stop him again.

Just a guess, but a newer trailer will more than likely come at Superbowl.","5hduh7",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

A FUCKING AWESOME MOVIE!!!

Holy shit this was amazing. Might honestly be the best marvel movie so far. It's either the original iron man, or this. I got an early screening, lucky me!

I used to be so pumped by the superhero movies. But when Batman v Superman showed up, I lost a lot of faith. Then suicide squad happened and that didn't help. I didn't even bother seeing guardians of the galaxy 2. I have Wonder Woman a try, but I was a bit disappointed by that movie too.

That being said, this movie has me pumped again. Marvel never lost sight and their vision is on track.

Did you like the original spider-man series? I did. I loved each one (besides the third that we don't talk about). Did you watch the amazing spider-man and cringe. Well that was me too. This Spider-Man is the best one yet. To be honest it's hard to compare to the original movies with Tobey Maguire since it's very different. Homecoming is a lot more light than the original. It's much more of a high school movie, which is great because it relates to the theme.
It's about learning to believe in yourself. Lots of films have this theme and mess it up. They either make the character too powerful to the point they don't have to really sacrifice anything to achieve greatness. Or they go the other way and just get ex machina help, learning nothing. But this movie balanced it perfectly. Parker is not a Mary Sue. He makes mistakes. He does stupid stuff even when he knows it stupid. He's a teenager. But he learns to trust himself and grow up. It's a really great arc. Nearly every scene with him helps push it forward.

All the acting is great. Micheal really brings it. At first his character seemed a bit one dimensional, but as the movie progresses so do our expectations of him. Robert Downey Jr. is great of course, but this time we seem him much more of a stern father figure, which is such a contrasting perspective to what we're used to seeing of the arrogant, sassy billionaire. Tom Holland of course captures peter Parker perfectly, in a unique teenage way we never got to see in Tobey.

The supporting characters are great. Lots of times in movies they introduce you to a bunch of characters at once that they try to force you to like just because they have quirks. But here they pull it off. Every character is just so likable. Even some of the baddies.
Any complaints would be very few. Only really technical complaints to boot. Sometimes the camera is VERY shaky. It's to simulate Parkers disorientation, but even then it's kind of hard to tell what happening. Also a bit of an epileptic warning. There's a scene where lots of flashing lights go off, that I wouldn't be surprised if it was enough to cause something bad. Another problem that really relates to all marvel music is the score. It's very vague. Just horns. Hard to tell the melody. My theory is that they do this on purpose for when all the heroes unite in infinity wars. Then they can switch the theme music very subtle. Just a theory, but this music can't touch Danny Elfman's score. One more problem is that Donald Glover wasn't very utilized. Felt like a waste for a man of his talents.

Anyways, that's it. Seriously. Everything else is gold. This movie is hilarious, charming, and relatable to almost anyone. If you've had doubts with superhero movies recently, put them to rest. Enjoy!

Ps. Please forgive any typos. Wrote this on my phone.","6k5p1l",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

"1832",1471390432,"StarWars","AO98","self.StarWars",4,2,2,0,"Should an Episode VIII teaser/trailer be attached to Spider-Man: Homecoming?","Earlier this year, there have been rumors that the first-ever teaser trailer for *Rogue One: A Star Wars Story* would be attached to theatrical screenings of the then highly-anticipated *Captain America: Civil War*. However, the teaser ended up debuting on April 7th instead, approximately a month before the cinematic release of *Civil War*.

Now while I am totally happy and grateful for the teaser debuting early, I still feel that Disney should have waited until *Civil War*'s release in May to debut it. *Captain America: Civil War* is definitely one of the best if not the absolute best of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and there are so many reasons why. It kicked off Phase 3 of the universe in a big epic way, we saw many of our favorite characters (minus Thor, the Hulk and Nick Fury) as well as the introductions of Black Panther and Spider-Man, and it also appeared to be the most emotional entry of the MCU, setting up a major conflict between the Avengers that should hopefully be fixed in the upcoming *Infinity War*.

Both *Civil War* and *Rogue One* were this year's biggest, most anticipated blockbusters. Airing the first-ever video footage for *Rogue One* right before *Civil War* was screened would have been probably the most genius move in cinematic history. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They would have brought in *Star Wars* fans, Marvel fans and general moviegoers altogether. It also would have potentially helped the movie gross some well-deserved extra money. Unfortunately, that was never the case.

However, next year not only marks the release of *Episode VIII*, but also *Spider-Man: Homecoming*, which will mark the sixth live-action film based on Spider-Man / Peter Parker, Tom Holland's second appearance as the legendary superhero following *Civil War* and the character's first solo film as part of the MCU. It is already one of next year's most-anticipated movies and between this and the other two MCU films planned for the next year (*Thor: Ragnarok* and *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2*), it's clearly the most hyped.

Personally speaking, I think Disney should take this opportunity that they missed last time and attach a teaser/trailer **(whether it's the 1st teaser or 2nd, or the first full trailer, whatever)** for *Star Wars Episode VIII* to theatrical screenings of *Spider-Man: Homecoming* when it is released on July 7th next year. As I explained with *Civil War*/*Rogue One*, this is an opportunity Disney can not miss. It'll create loads of hype and bring them loads of money.

What do you think? Should Disney tackle an opportunity like this? Do you agree they should have waited until *Civil War* to debut the *Rogue One* teaser? Or do you happen to disagree with all the above? Leave your thoughts. Thanks :) ","4y2kej",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

The scene makes little sense to the story and arc of Homecoming and would highly unlikely to near impossibly fit into the movie. I also apologise for the lack of detail or any continuity errors as I've literally just woke up and some points may seem ""what the fuck?"" But hey ho, I found the concept to be cool.

Anyways, here's the scene:

The scene starts with Peter stood atop a super quinjet, like the Bus from AOS, but wider and more flat, like a Stealth Bomber, on fire and damaged, about to go down. He turns around quickly to see Vulture circling around before diving at him. Peter manages to dodge it and the shot goes to a front view of Vulture, his helmet open faced before it seals shut to reveal the mask we all know. He quickly turns around and goes for another dive attack, this time, it hits him, and Peter grabs onto Vulture, climbing onto the back of the suit and begins to tear away at the suit before Vulture curses and throws a few insults at Peter, knowing his secret identity at this point. Once the suit has been damaged enough, Vulture decides to eject from the suit, revealing wings made of both metal and feather, as Peter leaps off and lands on a nearby skyscraper and watches as Vulture yells at Peter if that's the best he's got, to which Peter says no and then two fighter jets fly over, for some reason, the pilots being Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt. Vulture sees them and quickly flys away, boosting slightly since his wings are still somewhat mechanical as the jets quickly chase him out over the ocean, just above the clouds as Vulture dodges and weaves through the minigun rounds that are being fired at him. Before long he takes a big dive towards the ocean and we get a shot of the HUD for the gun, of McGregors fighter as he claims he has a lock before suddenly, it disappears. Ewan looks stunned for a second before a voice comes over the radio ""Jet 1, Come in Kenobi, did you get him?"" Peter asks, to which Ewan says no, assuming it was stealth tech that caused it. He and Emily Blunt fly back to the city as she assures him it's not his fault and that Vulture just simply got away. The shot goes to external showing the city from the point of view of McGregor as the Super Quinjet crashes into the water, into a huge explosion of flames and water. Peter lands down on the ground and quickly changes out his damaged suit and finds Aunt May, giving her a huge hug and apologising as he went somewhere safe like she taught him. The shot goes to a older couple finding their adoptive daughter who is around 5, and her pet lizard as she looks at Peter and smiled, making a *thwip thwip* emote to him, like from the cartoons as Peter looks at her stunned before quickly shaking his head.

END SCENE


If you guys have any ideas in which to make this scene better or your own dreams you've had about movie scenes then don't be afraid to comment. I'd love to hear them. :

Edit: After submitting this, I thought it would be cool to replace Emily Blunt with Brie Larson and have Carol Danvers be the second pilot. Would make more sense in the MCU and would be a cool Easter Egg.","5ilxju",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

*****
&gt; The first full trailer for Sony and Marvel&amp;#039;s Spider-Man: Homecoming debuted on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Thursday, introducing the first look at Tom Holland&amp;#039;s standalone Spidey movie.

&gt; The new footage offers a glimpse at Michael Keaton&amp;#039;s villainous Vulture, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, and plenty of web-slinging action from Holland&amp;#039;s young hero, Peter Parker, including a scene in which he takes down some bank robbers who are wearing Avengers masks.

&gt; Stark also tells Peter he&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;Not ready&amp;quot; to handle the &amp;quot;Flying monster guy&amp;quot; - presumably Keaton&amp;#039;s Vulture, who promises, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#039;t mess with me, because I will kill you and everybody you love&amp;quot; - but Parker doesn&amp;#039;t want to listen to his Avenger mentor.

&gt; The trailer, which prominently features MGMT&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;Time To Pretend,&amp;quot; also highlights Peter&amp;#039;s high school life, where he and his best friend Ned pine after the beautiful Liz to the annoyance of Michelle.

&gt; On Wednesday, Sony shared a short, 18-second teaser that showed Happy Hogan presenting Peter with a gift from Tony Stark: an upgraded suit, complete with Steve Ditko-inspired web wings.

&gt; See the trailer above, and the international trailer, which features a few extra Tony Stark lines, below.

If this report is accurate (which it definitely might not be) then I would assume that Laura Harrier's unnamed but ""key role"" character may be Liz Allen. But that begs the question, who is Zendaya?

"1925",1498515145,"Spiderman","lonestarphysics","self.Spiderman",13,2,NA,NA,"Does anyone else hate that Liz Allan will be in Spider-Man: Homecoming?","When we first meet Liz in the comics, she is a bully who makes fun of Peter (who has a crush on her). Then, once Peter finds a girl who actually likes him (Betty Brant), and beats Flash in the boxing match, Liz suddenly starts to like him, showing she probably cares less about his personality and more about dating the alpha-male (she does say to Flash a lot about ""oh, you don't have any brains so that's why I don't like you"", which begs the question of why are you just now deciding this after Peter uses his brawn?). So, now that she totally ""likes"" him, she begins to constantly interfere in Peter's budding relationship with Betty Brant, screwing everything up for everyone else. It's not comic book accurate to have Liz Allan because she was Peter's ""first love interest"", because very early on he basically starts to not give a shit about her! Betty Brant should be the lead in this movie if you are going to make that stupid accuracy argument (but there isn't even a Daily Bugle, which is another rant).

MCU Liz Allan seems to have much more in common with Earth -1610 MJ (pretty smart girls interested in Peter), excluding the fact that Liz will probably be popular in the movie and won't be a longtime friend of Peter. However, if you are going to make Liz Allan not Liz Allan, why call her Liz Allan!? Just rename her MJ, because that is basically who she is going to be. Oh, and would you like to know what Earth-1610 Liz Allan is like? She is a popular girl who doesn't understand why MJ even likes Peter! She is a mutant-hater, who later turns out to be a mutant.

Liz Allan eventually gets better and more mature in both universes, but I still hate her early incarnations and very strongly believe she shouldn't be in the new movie.","6joeez",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

I would really like to see a menacing and dark Vulture. I am not a fan of villains with humour as much, as a lot of the time their joking undermines their scariness. I was thinking of Jackie Earl Harley from Watchmen, I think he is intense enough and has got the right look.

"2070",1462483452,"marvelstudios","CMORGLAS","self.marvelstudios",7,1,1,0,"In Defense of Vulture being the Main Villain of Spider-Man: Homecoming.","Now, I will concede that Vulture might not be as flashy as Mysterio, or as badass as Kraven, but I believe that Adrian Toomes can be an excellent foil to Peter Parker.

Admittedly, the most iconic storyline about the Vulture (barring his Sinister Six collaborations) is his origin, that of an elderly inventor whose partner embezzled all of his money and turned to a life of crime when he lost his job.

However, I believe there is a way to make a more nuanced villain that could rival Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus or Thomas Haden Church's Sandman.

The most compelling Vulture story I've ever read is ""Marvel Knights: Spider-Man ""Down Among the Dead Men"".

[Here's the Highlight Reel.](http://hellzyeahthewebwieldingavenger.tumblr.com/tagged/the-most-messed-up-thing-is-that-this-is-from-the-same-writer-who-gave-us-Ultimate-Red-Skull)

So, what if, the two stories were COMBINED?

Adrian Toomes has his wing harness' patent stolen out from under him, his son Riley (no last name given in Winter Soldier) gets shot down while wearing it, and much like Daedalus, Toomes outlives his son.

To make matters worse, his grandson is diagnosed with Leukemia, and Adrian COULD have afforded the treatment if his partner hadn't screwed him over. So, Adrian decides to turn to a life of crime to pay for his grandson's treatment.

To quote Gus Fring from Breaking Bad, ""A man PROVIDES for his family.""

This also might be what encourages Peter Parker to get a job at the Bugle, to ease the financial burden on the Parker Household.

There we have it, two generations of inventors and their struggles to provide for their families. Also, Falcon's existence means we don't have to waste as much time on Vulture's Origin, and that gives the film more time to flesh out his motivation.

So, what do you think?","4i21ya",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

&gt; Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios&amp;#039; &amp;quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming,&amp;quot; the long-awaited solo debut of Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is looking at a possible $100 million-plus opening at the domestic box office this weekend.

&gt; Independent trackers have the film making $90-110 million this weekend, with Sony Pictures projecting a more conservative $80 million from 4,341 locations.

&gt; By comparison, Sony&amp;#039;s last Spider-Man film, the Andrew Garfield-starring &amp;quot;Amazing Spider-Man 2,&amp;quot; opened to $91.6 million and went on to rack up a $202.8 million domestic cume.

&gt; The biggest opening for a Spidey film belongs to the Tobey Maguire era, with &amp;quot;Spider-Man 3&amp;quot; grossing $151 million in its opening and going on to gross $890.1 million worldwide in 2007.

&gt; It&amp;#039;s only been 15 years since the first &amp;quot;Spider-Man&amp;quot; swung into theaters and kicked off the Marvel movie craze in earnest by becoming the first movie to open with more than $100 million.

&gt; &amp;quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&amp;quot; takes place a few months after the events of &amp;quot;Civil War,&amp;quot; with Peter Parker returning to his double life as a high school student and neighborhood crime fighter in Queens, but yearning for another taste of the Avenger life that he experienced while fighting alongside Iron Man.

"2247",1499374752,"MyMovieThoughts","thrawawaway","self.MyMovieThoughts",0,1,NA,NA,"Spider-Man: Homecoming","A movie I thoroughly enjoyed although I found it to be a little long.  
I am glad they skipped the backstory of Spiderman since we already have 2 movies for that.  
The actors are fairly unknown but I can't think of anyone I would consider bad, they all did a good job representing their characters.  
The jokes were in my opinion spot on throughout the hole movie and it made me laugh fairly often.  
The action scenes were great but the cuts were a little much at times.  
I am very happy about the decision on making the movie about Spiderman and keeping the Avengers out of it except from a scene here and there.

* Spiderman was great. Dorky when he was out of the suit, confident and cocky when he was in. It was fun to see how he progressed throughout the movie.  
* Peter Parkers friend Ned was definitively one of the highlights in the movie and is a very lovable characters. He has a curious personality and has a lot of fun scenes in the movie.   
* The ""bully"" in the movie was kinda pointless, maybe he was there just to show us how petty high-school can really be but his whole character was just awkward and didn't really add much to the movie.  
* The villain was good. He pulled off the imitating factor well and he seemed realistic enough when it comes to the motives.  
* The last character I want to talk about is Karen, the robot in Spiderman's suit. I find that they made her a little too human but she provided with some very funny scenes and lines in the movie.  
  
Overall this movie was fun, action packed, and I highly recommend it.

It's called Homecoming. And he doesn't go?!
After the final battle was the perfect time to go back and surprise Liz and have some cool 1980s like school dance/disco scene with nice music and a kiss between them. Not like all choreographed and in musical-form, but like the Back to the Future ending. 

I seriously don't understand why they called it Homecoming and had it as a recurring arc in  the film for us not to get one.

Perhaps Peter should have had the dance before he left to fight. 
After a movie of him disappointing his friends due to his Spiderman commitment, he should have stayed that one time, and afterwards for the final battle. Or go BACK after the final battle.

How can they be inspired by John Hughes and not have a nice teen drama dance/disco scene?

And, NO, I am not talking about emo Peter Parker, because that is not what Homecoming dances are like before anyone goes ""ew, no cuz be like emo and stupid and ruin it all""","6londn",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

&gt; The only film that currently has a release date after 2019&amp;#039;s mysterious fourth Avengers movie is the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming.

&gt; Two months after the release of Avengers 4, the second Spider-Man movie comes out.

&gt; Wth each Spider-Man movie likely happening during part of a different school year, it seems everything that could happen over the course of two Avengers movies-fighting Thanos, meeting the Guardians of the Galaxy, traveling to space, whatever else you can image-is almost too much to happen on a summer vacation between sophomore and junior years.

&gt; &amp;quot;So, coming out two months after Untitled Avengers, much of what the next Spider-Man film will be about.""

&gt; As for the rest of the films in Phase 4? Outside of Spider-Man, Feige doesn&amp;#039;t think any announcements will be made until after Avengers 4.

&gt; The Untitled fourth Avengers films is out May 3, 2019 and Phase Four of the MCU kicks off with Spider-Man Homecoming 2 on July 5, 2019..

“When’s our next mission?”

“We’ll call you.”

Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man, has just completed his first mission with the Avengers, and he’s eager for further adventures. But Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man, thinks Peter could use a bit more seasoning—he’s only 15, after all—and encourages the boy to work on being a “friendly neighborhood Spider-Man” for a while before getting called back up to the Big Show. So he gives the kid the number for his security chief, Happy Hogan. Peter, needless to say, texts and calls—and then texts and calls some more—without response.

It’s a perfect setup for _Spider-Man: Homecoming_: Peter Parker—high-school nerd, eternal outsider, the guy whose greatest successes somehow wind up feeling like failures—waiting by the phone for a call that never comes.

When Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios announced they were teaming up to re-boot Spider-Man once more—the third iteration of the character in 15 years—it was easy to be skeptical. Sony’s first bite at the apple, with Tobey Maguire, fell apart [by the end](http://ift.tt/2tUy1t7), and the second, with Andrew Garfield, barely got [off the ground](http://ift.tt/2utfUr4) at all. But Marvel demonstrates once again that it knows exactly what it’s doing with one of its premier characters: _Homecoming_, starring Tom Holland in the titular role, is an utter gas, a fast and very funny superflick that inserts Spidey into the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe without ever losing sight of what makes him unique and beloved.

The movie opens with a mini-movie—really more of a video diary—by Peter himself, briefly recounting the character’s reintroduction as a [temporary Avenger](http://ift.tt/2qqwRiD) in _Captain America: Civil War_. (“No one has actually told me what I’m doing in Berlin,” he narrates to his smartphone. “Something about Captain America going crazy.”) But when it’s over, it’s over. And Peter, having had a taste of full-on superheroism, is back to being an ordinary, not terribly popular high-schooler in Queens.

Well, not quite ordinary. He still has his superpowers, the high-tech suit with which Stark outfitted him, and an abiding desire to fight crime. If he can find any, that is. To the brilliant accompaniment of the Ramones’ “Blitzkrieg Bop” (_Hey! Ho! Let’s go!_), Peter confronts an apparent car thief who turns out to be the owner of the vehicle in question, and recovers a stolen bike that may or may not have actually been stolen. But finally he spots a genuine ATM heist being carried out by goons wielding super-high-tech weaponry.

Did you ever wonder what happened to all the futuristic alien gear with which the Chitauri attacked New York in the [first Avengers movie](http://ift.tt/2uto7vz)? Well in theory, it wound up in the hands of a joint venture between the government and Stark Industries called the Department of Damage Control. But given that 1,500 tons of the stuff was scattered throughout the tri-state area, inevitably some of it fell into the wrong hands. And two of those hands belonged to Adrian Toomes, a construction engineer with a decidedly Trumpian sense of aggrievement at the rich elites (looking at you, Tony Stark) who he believes have looked down at him all his life. To compel them to start looking up, he equips himself with giant turbo-powered wings and goes into business quietly selling weapons constructed from Chitauri technology: black hole grenades, anti-gravity guns, and the world’s nastiest joy buzzer.

Thus, even as it reinvents the typical Marvel hero as a shy kid with a severe high-school crush, _Homecoming_also reinvents the typical Marvel villain: Toomes—occasionally people refer to him as “Vulture,” though he doesn’t seem to bother with the moniker himself—is not bent on global dominion or destroying the Avengers or any such grandiose endeavor. All he wants is to stay below the radar and make a few bucks selling contraband arms. Needless to say, Spider-Man wants to stop him and, given that he isn’t able to get the Avengers interested, decides to go it alone.

_Homecoming_gets so many things right that it’s almost difficult to catalog them. For starters, there’s no origin story: no radioactive spider and Uncle Ben getting shot and “with great power comes great responsibility” speech and on and on. If you really don’t know how Peter Parker became Spider-Man, look up one of the earlier movies. Peter does still live with his Aunt May, but she’s been reconceived from an elderly widow to younger surrogate-mom played by a very good Marisa Tomei. (A less successful reconception involves Spidey’s gadget-laden suit, which even talks to him; Stark product or no, it can’t help but feel just a little too Iron Man-y.)

As Peter, Holland exudes a sense of boyish wonder even more boyishly wondrous than that of his predecessors. Robert Downey Jr. and Jon Favreau reprise their longstanding roles as Tony Stark and Happy Hogan, respectively, though the former looks as though he may be tiring of the gig after three _Iron Man_s, two _Avengers_, and a _Captain America_. And Michael Keaton is both marvelously cast—he’s almost certainly the best Marvel villain since Loki—and, post-[_Birdman_](http://ift.tt/2tUur1T), a doubly wicked inside joke on what was already, post-_Batman_, a wicked inside cinematic joke.

Peter’s classmates at Midtown Tech are a likably diverse bunch, featuring a nice romantic bait and switch (even if you see it coming), and a hilarious turn by Jacob Batalon as Peter’s best friend, Ned. (“Do you lay eggs?” he asks, upon learning his buddy’s super-identity. “Do you spit venom?”) High-school bully Flash Thompson is reinvented from a tall, Aryan jock to a diminutive alpha-geek played by Tony Revolori from _The Grand Budapest Hotel_. And a teacher played by Martin Starr (Gilfoyle from _Silicon Valley_) appropriately gets the funniest line in the movie and, arguably, Marvel Studios history to date.

Clever gags are everywhere to be found, which is unsurprising given that the director, Jon Watts, and the many listed screenwriters have their principal roots in TV comedy. The movie’s title, _Homecoming_, technically refers to Peter’s high-school dance, but it’s foundationally a joke about Spider-Man at last joining the Marvel stable. _Captain America_’s Chris Evans makes a few cameos in Public Service Announcements on the importance of staying in shape and avoiding detention. (As the gym teacher who shows the first clip drily notes, “I’m pretty sure this guy is a war criminal now.”) High-school girls play “Marry, F***, Kill” with members of the Avengers, and there are witty bits involving the difficulty of webslinging in the suburbs (not enough tall buildings to swing from), Stark’s marital reticence, what comes after “screwing the pooch,” and the iconic upside-down kiss from the 2002 _Spider-Man_. There’s even a (sort of) invisible jet to make up for the one that went missing from [_Wonder Woman_](http://ift.tt/2rymsWi).

But in the end, it comes down to Marvel’s deep reverence for character, and the studio’s understanding that every superhero is different. After the extraterrestrial meanderings of the Guardians of the Galaxy and the save-the-world mandates of the Avengers—to say nothing of the grim offerings served up by DC Comics pre-_Wonder Woman_—it feels like just the right time for a friendly, neighborhood Spider-Man. Hey! Ho! Let’s go!

 That 'Wonder Woman' overperformed in North America does not mean 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' has a new bar for success.

&gt; What makes Runaways such an exciting and eagerly anticipated venture? Other than being an adaption that would be aimed at a much younger audience - young adult, to be exact, but not without enough content to still appeal to the mass Marvel audience - it also has a compelling plot that is unlike anything we&amp;#039;ve seen from the Cinematic Universe thus far.

&gt; Not only that, but Runaways features a cast of characters that fans have been clamoring for - diverse, skewed in the favor of ladies, and chock to the brim with much needed role models for people of all races, sexualities and sizes.

&gt; They use their newfound powers and abilities to band together and take down their parents, and continue long after The Pride has been removed from their position of power - both to atone for their parents&amp;#039; sins, and to prevent other villainous organizations rising up in their place.

&gt; Where You&amp;#039;ve Seen Her: Arrested Development, Parenthood, The DUFF. Gertrude &amp;quot;Gert&amp;quot; Yorkes had always been distrustful of her parents, even before they were revealed to be members of a criminal organization.

&gt; The youngest member of the Runaways at 11-years-old, Molly Hayes is a mutant with super-human strength.

&gt; As the youngest, Molly also missed her parents the most, and has to be reminded by the rest of the team that they are villains.

&gt; Spider-Man: Homecoming brings us our third Spider-Man in 15 years, but this webslinger&amp;#039;s got something his predecessors didn&amp;#039;t: a hookup to the Avengers.

&gt; The new poster makes that crystal-clear, positioning the Avengers tower smack-dab in the middle of the Manhattan skyline.

&gt; Our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man is there, too, chillin&amp;#039; like a villain on the water&amp;#039;s edge.

&gt; In addition to his signature blue-and-red suit, Spider-Man&amp;#039;s rocking a bright yellow blazer emblazoned with his school&amp;#039;s insignia.

&gt; While Tom Holland&amp;#039;s Peter Parker will be flying solo in Spider-Man: Homecoming, he&amp;#039;ll get a visit from Robert Downey Jr.&amp;#039;s Iron Man.

&gt; He&amp;#039;s due to reunite with a bunch of Marvel&amp;#039;s other heroes in next year&amp;#039;s Avengers: Infinity War, after meeting a bunch of them in last year&amp;#039;s Captain America: Civil War.

"2831",1471832928,"FanTheories","dlay96","self.FanTheories",7,1,1,0,"(MCU THEORY) Spider-Man: Homecoming, Michael Keaton's Vulture is Riggan Thomson from Birdman","So we all know by now that Michael Keaton is playing the villain Vulture in Spider-Man: Homecoming. This is especially interesting considering Michael Keaton's role as Riggan Thomson in the 2014 Best Picture winner, Birdman. 

For those who haven't seen it, you should, first of all. It's a satirical black comedy about Riggan Thomson, a washed out actor known only for his role as the titular hero Birdman in the 80's movies, reflective of Keaton's actual turn as Batman in the 80's Tim Burton films. The movie follows him as he prepares his Broadway show which he hopes will restart his career.

It's funny because 3 years after playing the lead in BIRDman, which comments on comic book movies and his own career as a superhero movie star, he will be playing the bird based villain in another comic book film. 

This got me thinking how Birdman might be if you were to watch it picturing it takes places within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Here's the theory I created.

In the history of known American superheroes within the MCU, the timeline looks like this. Steve Rogers as Captain America was obviously 'The First Avenger' and became an American icon before his supposed death. This was in the mid-1940s. Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne were saving the day as Ant-Man and the Wasp in the 60s and 70s, but that was all secret. So it's believed there were no public superheroes until 60 years later when Iron Man would come around. This isn't the case.

Riggan Thomson started his career as the superhero Birdman in the mid-1970s. It started as small time street vigilantism in New York City, but slowly grew to peacekeeping across the nation. 

He became wildly popular. So popular that Hollywood went to him with movie deals and merchandising deals. Riggan wasn't really the most morally upright or honorable guy, plus he loved his new fame, so he signed the deals right away, under the circumstance he could star in the films. Crime had dropped to an all time low cause of him and then he had time to start making the movies.

The first movie released in 1979 and was a massive success. A sequel was greenlit immediatly. 

The second was a little artistically weird but still really good, but wasn't recieved as well. It's 1982 release made half as much money as the last, but that was still enough the warrant a third. 

The director of the first two, who had become close friends with Riggan, gets pushed out of the studio. They bring in a new director who wants to recast Birdman all together, but Riggan won't allow it. The two of them have a very hostile relationship throughout production and the end result is a mess. Birdman 3: The Fall (an ironically prophetic title) is basically laughed out of theaters after its release in 1985.

Riggan turns to drinking and tries to clean up the little bit of crime still remaining to recapture the real glory of Birdman. On many occasions, he ends up embarrassing himself. Flying through the city one night, he can hear people mocking him. In 1986, he officially retires Birdman and starts a family. 

Flash forward 28 years, Riggan is only remembered for the Birdman movies. His heroics are all but forgotten due to the emergence of new heroes. The Avengers have risen to massive popularity after the Battle of New York. 

Riggan is preparing his Broadway show to an attempt to restart his acting career. He resents this new crop of heroes. They're doing more than he ever did, are more popular than he ever was, and (in his mind) think they're better than him because they decline any movie deals. He's also angry because they've never approached him to join the Avengers, or even for advice or help.

In 2016, during one of the best performances of his Broadway show, Riggan feels on top off the world. Suddenly, the show is interrupted when Spider-Man is smashed through the wall during a fight with Rhino. The show is stopped and the theater is evacuated. Of course everyone pulls out their phones to film Spider-Man and the show is forgotten. Riggan is left on the stage cursing out Spider-Man. All future showings of the play are canceled and Riggan is ruined. 

He swears revenge against Spider-Man and 30 years after retiring, he takes out his old Birdman costume, makes some adjustments and emerges as the villain Vulture.

EDIT: TL;DR. Vulture in Spiderman Homecoming is actually Riggan Thomson from Birdman, who was the superhero Birdman in the 70s and 80s. Forgotten and washed up after the Birdman movies, he now resents The Avengers and the like. After his Broadway show is interrupted by Spider-Man, Riggan swears revenge and becomes Vulture.","4yyg9v",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

"3145",1481435511,"marvelstudios","HighTreazon","self.marvelstudios",5,1,1,0,"A fully-formed Spider-Man: Homecoming timeline theory","After much thought I think I have come up with a definitive timeline for the footage we have seen, along with reasoning, both within the diegesis and from a corporate/studio perspective.  
So as many people have noted, both the post Civil War Stark tech Spidey suit AND the home-made pre Civil War ""hoodie"" suit are shown in the film, at multiple points.  
Notably, the home-made costume appears in two sequences:  
  

The first time we see the homemade suit is in the school bus parking lot fight (@1:50 in the domestic trailer), where the international trailer shows additional footage of Bokeem Woodbine's Shocker (#1) fighting Peter (@0:51).  

The second instance of the homemade suit is in the sand on what looks like Coney Island, it what is probably the climactic showdown between Spidey and the Vulture (a fully-suited Vulture is shown here as well).  

Before I go further, I also want to note that a bearded Logan Marshall-Green (shown standing next to Donald Glover) is wearing the same Shocker uniform as Bokeem Woodbine in the domestic trailer (@1:46) as well.  

Contrary to many people's comments on this site, Marshall-Green is NOT playing The Tinkerer. It has been [confirmed](http://deadline.com/2016/08/michael-chernus-spider-man-homecoming-villains-1201801646/) that Michael Chernus will be playing the Tinkerer, not Marshall-Green.  
This, in combination with the obvious similarity in costume, and some other rumours and casting sheets that have appeared online seems to confirm there will be atleast two people inheriting the title of Shocker in the film.  
 
  
I propose the following:  
The school bus parking lot fight against a Chitauri weaponry-wielding Bokeem Woodbine's Shocker is a flashback, *before* the events of *Captain America: Civil War*.  
This will serve to show that Peter was already out risking his life and fighting ""low grade"" bad guys before Tony Stark ever came along. This provides character context, and demonstrates his independence. It also is importantly showing his humble origins, especially in terms of the suit. This will be important to the later plot development.  
Spider presumably defeats Bokeem Woodbine, and then moves on, up through the events of Civil War. Now with a new suit and newfound confidence under Stark's wing, Peter has assumed a slightly different Spider-Man identity.  
Meanwhile, Logan Marshall-Green's character--whether an associate, friend, or criminal rival of Woodbine's character--takes up his fallen colleague's quilted suit (or perhaps they belonged to a gang with this  same uniform) and becomes the Shocker 2.0, this time wielding what looks to be Stark-tech modulated to work in tandem with the Chitauri purple glowing weaponry. We already know that Michael Chernus' Tinkerer will be supplying modified Chitauri weaponry to multiple criminals in the film, including the masked thieves from the ATM, the Shocker 1.0, and The Vulture himself. My guess is that Donald Glover's character may be a former employee of Tony Stark, hence the Stark-tech gauntlet now being wielded by Marshall-Green's Shocker 2.0. This not only shows us Spidey's rogue gallery reinventing itself in true comic book fashion, but also ties Stark into the story on another level besides his recruitment of Peter.  
 
Still with me?  
Okay so here is where it comes together.  
Even this first trailer makes a point to illustrate Peter's frustration with Tony's controlling attitude, and although Tony is obviously coming from a good place, Peter will likely rebel against him at some point in the film, and go after The Vulture despite his warnings.  
At this point, Tony will either take away the Civil War Spidey suit (along with it's even newer upgrades), OR Peter will give it back to Tony as a gesture of rejecting his patronship and needing to find himself as a hero.  
Hence why we see a home-made costumed Peter facing off with the Vulture at what is almost definitely the climax of the film.  
  
TLDR; There are two Shockers: Woodbine plays Shocker 1.0 wielding Chitauri tech against Peter in his home-made costume BEFORE the events of Civil War. Marshall-Green plays Shocker 2.0, succeeding his fallen predecessor wielding Chitauri AND Stark tech against Peter in his Civil War costume, probably in an Act 2 set piece, implicating Tony as well. And lastly Peter will don the homemade costume once more against the Vulture towards the end, after either: Tony takes the Civil War suit back from Peter OR Peter gives it back to him indicating his need to find his own path/not wanting Tony to track him.

&gt; Sony has released the electronic press kit for Spider-Man: Homecoming, which includes a cast list that reveals several new cast additions and surprise villains.

&gt; First up is the news that Jennifer Connelly is returning to the Marvel universe following her role in Ang Lee&amp;#039;s Hulk, and is set to play Karen/Suit Lady.

&gt; We also get confirmation that Gwyneth Paltrow is returning as Pepper Potts, as well as Angourie Rice&amp;#039;s role as Betty Brant.

&gt; A young Peter Parker/Spider-Man, who made his sensational debut in Captain America: Civil War, begins to navigate his newfound identity as the web-slinging super hero in Spider-Man: Homecoming.

&gt; Thrilled by his experience with the Avengers, Peter returns home, where he lives with his Aunt May, under the watchful eye of his new mentor Tony Stark.

&gt; Peter tries to fall back into his normal daily routine - distracted by thoughts of proving himself to be more than just your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man - but when the Vulture emerges as a new villain, everything that Peter holds most important will be threatened.

&gt; Marvel Studios head honcho Kevin Feige introduced Spider-Man: Homecoming director Jon Watts and Co. to the Hall H stage at Comic-Con Saturday night, but kept the identities of Zendaya, Tony Revolori, Jacob Batalon, and Laura Harrier&amp;#039;s characters under waps.

&gt; Watts put us on a first-name basis with them during an interview with EW. According to the filmmaker, Zendaya plays Michelle, Revolori plays Flash, Harrier plays Liz, and Batalon plays Ned.

&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;#039;m bully and I don&amp;#039;t know how cool he is, but when we call cut, I&amp;#039;m just like, &amp;#039;Ah! You&amp;#039;re so cool,&amp;#039;&amp;quot; Revolori recalls of working with Tom Holland, who plays the title character.

&gt; Watts and his cast wouldn&amp;#039;t confirm who&amp;#039;s playing the character, but reports point to Michael Keaton, who&amp;#039;s now officially a member of the cast.

&gt; &amp;quot;Vulture&amp;#039;s the first real villain in the Spider-Man comics,&amp;quot; Watts says, &amp;quot;He&amp;#039;s in the second issue. He&amp;#039;s one of the classics from the best rogues&amp;#039; gallery out there, and we&amp;#039;ve never seen him, he&amp;#039;s never been brought to life.""

&gt; Spider-Man: Homecoming is scheduled to hit theaters July 7, 2017.

*****
&gt; Michael Keaton, who in April was in early talks for a villainous role in the Sony-Marvel collaboration/reboot Spider-Man: Homecoming before falling out, is back in the mix again and we&amp;#039;ve been told his deal has closed.

&gt; He apparently set to play iconic Spider-Man villain The Vulture and joins newly minted Spider-Man Tom Holland along with Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. who are also confirmed.

&gt; The Vulture&amp;#039;s first encounter with Spider-Man happens to be the in-universe reason Peter Parker got his most famous day job, freelance photographer for tabloid paper The Daily Bugle - Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson offered a reward to anyone who could get a picture of The Vulture.

&gt; Ruffalo of course will play The Hulk as he has throughout the current Marvel Universe.

&gt; For the interested, Grandmaster is one of Marvel&amp;#039;s Elders of the Universe, the long-lived, last surviving members of an ancient, otherwise extinct race, all of whom cope with the boredom of existence by obsessively pursuing a specific personal interest.

&gt; Hela is the Marvel Comics version of the Norse Goddess Hel, who rules the afterlife and frequently has tried using armies of her realm to conquer other worlds.

But what if it's actually Beetle? Any scene you could do with Vulture, you could also do with Beetle; you could tie his suit to Iron Man's gear; and it continues the bug theme. Plus, it has one other potential benefit.

We've already met Zemo in Civil War. So what if they introduce Beetle in Spider-Man, Goliath in the Ant-Man sequel, and Moonstone in Captain Marvel? That's almost the entire Thunderbolts team right there. They could find smaller roles for Fixer and Screaming Mimi (Fixer could build and maintain the Beetle suit, for instance), or they could bring in Klaw and Batroc. 

Either way, this seems very plausible to me. The two main issues with having the Thunderbolts show up so far are that (1) they haven't used any of the villains associated with the team, and (2) very few of the villains they have used are still alive. But they could be using Phase 3 to change that.","4lkrqy",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

"4147",1471727678,"marvelstudios","SubservantSnoopDogg","self.marvelstudios",17,0,0,0,"Let's talk about Spider-Man: Homecoming","First and foremost, I must praise and show my faith in our courageous lord and savior.

While I have every faith in Feige, I cannot help but be concerned with some of the news relating to Spider-Man.

There are *numerous* concerns in my mind in this movie. Once again, I trust and respect that the overlord will produce a great movie, but I must air my grievances. I'm not speaking for everyone- only myself; some people might have the same opinion and not articulate it in such detail, others had a knee jerk response, and some might very well be low-key racist. That's not me and they're not me.

Let's get the eight-legged horse out of the room first. The thing on most people's minds right now is the Zendaya casting controversy (God I hate that word). Really, it's part of a broader racial issue.
Let me be clear- as someone from diverse background (Lebanese, Egyptian, Finnish)- I accept and welcome that we live in a diverse world, and that as popcorn movies rather than true film, superhero movies need to reflect that. Naturally, characters from a fifty year old comic will need some revision to fit in the modern world. But I do take issue with casting of SM:H. If the rumors are true that Zendaya (Half-black/half-white) will play Mary Jane Watson (fully white) I can't say that I'm a fan of the choice. Not just because of the race difference, granted. I can't say much to her acting ability, but to me, she just doesn't fit as Mary Jane. I can't explain it, but if she were fully white, I'd say the same. I guess you could call it the visual energy. The character and the actress don't vibe on the same wave length in my eye. Don't get me wrong *if* she's Mary Jane, I'll still see the movie and give the performance a chance.

Now on the other hand, comics are a visual art form, and thus I feel that films should represent it accordingly. And that brings up this question. Why can't we have characters who are already minorities? I have no problem in the world with this actress in a Spider-Man movie. But why not put her in the role of Michelle and modify it to the story? It's not as a big a role, but they could do that. Silk (Of whom I'm a fan) is apparently in the movie and I'm glad. She seamlessly can translate from the comics as such. 

the same does not necessarily apply for the other characters. Mary Jane is a visually striking and iconic character. I'm hoping we'll see a Jane Birkin, Pamela Courson-like (With darker hair, of course) MJ on screen. On the other hand Flash Thompson, Liz Allen, and Ned Leeds are not visually iconic characters. You wouldn't recognize them the way you would Mary Jane- regardless of the artist or interpretation. Her image is iconic. And for the record, I loved Curtis Vondie-Hall as Ben Urich.

On the subject of Flash, Ned, Liz, and Betty, I am concerned with their portrayal, regardless of race. I hear (And remember, all of this is based on rumors swirling around) Flash will serve as an intellectual rival to Peter. And while a bully can definitely hurt you with his mind of body (Believe me, I know) that doesn't fit the character. Flash is envious of Peter's intelligence, and that's part of why he preys on him. He likes the super hero of Spider-Man because he wants to be a smart witty hero, he wants to be under that mask, and he hates Peter because he has those same traits  but Flash can't pretend they're his. That doesn't work for an intellectual rival. Then what, does he bully Peter because he's intelligent. And even if he feels Peter's more intelligent, it's not the same dichotomy. 

On the Liz Allen front, I'm looking forward to Laura Harrier. She visually reminds me of the character and has the right kind of energy. Not much else to say.

Ned Leeds and Betty Brant (rumor) strike me as odd and concern me. Why would two characters who are historically adults to Peter's teenage years his peers? It seems like an odd choice. But I think I've figured it out. The intention is most likely that the characters will grow up through the franchise and all end up working at the Bugle as adults. I don't know that they'd do the Hobgoblin story, but I feel that Ned Leeds will probably ""shoot up"" (Not drugs, that's Harry Osborn) and grow into an in-shape adult. That happens to kids.

TL;DR: MJ is a visually iconic character and should look as close to the comics as possible. The races of the other characters don't really matter because they're not iconic; I feel we should include more characters that were created diverse instead of retrofitting.

P.S. If you're trying to make a strong minority character, don't give him or her someone else's identity. Eventually they will be replaced with the original (Rhodey as Iron Man) and only act as a part of the original character's history. Give them their own identity and they will have enduring success and actually mean something (Black Panther, Luke Cage, Blue Marvel, Silk)

I'm also concerned on some other fronts. These are quicker to say though.
Michael Keaton is too young for Vulture; Creed Bratton would be better. Tinkerer should be an old man. Together they would greatly mirror Spider-Man; young vs. old. Vulture is not a good headlining villain so don't expect him to break the purported trend of lame villains. 

TL;DR: Honestly, I think Sony might be behind a lot of this. I love the character and the MCU, and you bet I'll see it and I'll probably love it. But there are some concerns I have.","4yr86f",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

 Last September I spent the day at Marvel Studios in Atlanta learning all about Spider-Man: Homecoming. 

This wasn't the press junket/tour that big comic book and entertainment sites have written about. THAT was a set visit after interview panels at a hotel. My day was a hands-on deep dive into the movie and the offscreen/onscreen talent behind it. 

Anyway, I'd be happy to share what I did and what I learned but I'm not sure if any of YOU want to hear about it. I'm not saying this to tease or get attention - I just don't want to jump in and share details without knowing if you'd all think I was showing off or bragging. 

I don't do spoilers (I'm not allowed to share them, anyway), so there's no need to worry about getting secret plot details :) 

So...just let me know if you're interested or not interested. If the interested people are in the minority I'll still get the info to you. ","651mzt",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

The plot I imagined for the movie would be Peter having to stop the vulture while at the same time trying to juggling finding a date, going to Homecoming dance, and could have some fun scenes of him trying to discretely sneak in and out of the dance, trying to balance stopping a Vulture plot while also trying to make his date not realize what's up and keep her from storming off in a huff by his constant coming and going. 

In short, the title painted a fun picture of a good young Peter Parker story and the obvious ""high school = Homecoming dance"" connection.. Now, however, from what I've seen of the trailers there is no mention of Homecoming being an actual plot point. So does Homecoming literally just mean ""Spider-Man is coming home to the MCU""? Is that all this subtitle references?

I know it wouldn't get used irl but it just felt right to me. 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HHOwYqxBbWU

Can you think of any songs or music that would fit a final swing scene? I really love the Danny Elfman one from the Raimi films.

Don't feel obliged to read this bit, it's just a brief description of my ideal final swing scene with 'Where No One Goes' playing.

I would start the scene with Peter on the top of a building in his suit (unmasked) as the song begins, he puts his mask on and begins to run as the music builds and leaps off the building as the lyrics begin (0:22) where he proceeds to show off some of his awesome swinging. I could also imagine him coming to a brief stop as he lands perched on a crane or something at 0:53 and the camera just pans around him before swinging off again at 1:12. Obviously the song would be shortened (as much as I would love to watch him swing around for 3mins) but I would have the scene/film end with Spider-Man web zipping at the camera at 2:35 (similar to the first Raimi film but have the whole mask cut the film to black as opposed to one of his eyes).","6j40cb",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

I've read a bit about Miles Morales and the whole campaign for Donald Glover to play him in the MCU. 

I have a bunch more questions about this whole thing, has there even been Miles Morales and Peter Parker as Spider-Man at the same time situation and do you think that's foreseeable in the MCU

"4263",1487475949,"marvelstudios","Gal_Gadot","self.marvelstudios",42,0,NA,NA,"I wish they picked a more inspired choice of director with Spider-Man: Homecoming.","If you've seen What We Do In The Shadows or Hunt For The Wilderpeople, you'd know that Taika Waititi brings a very distinct style of directing, packed with heart, laughter and emotion. That combined with Team Thor, and his Reddit AMA where you talks about pushing their characters to their boundaries and bringing an 80s, road trip feel to the movie got me excited. The same goes for James Gunn. GoTG feels and looks like the work of a director instead of committee, with distinct cinematography and creativity you couldn't get from anyone else. It makes me exciting for GoTG2.

In comparison, HC is my least anticipated MCU film of the year by a mile because the trailer looked line a run of the mill Spider-Man film, from the TV style cinematography and the reluctance to innovate the character. I wish they hired someone like Shane Black as opposed to Jon Watts.

Shane Black directed *Kiss Kiss Bang Bang* and *The Nice Guys*. These are movies with such a bouncy, breezy directing style and a sense of humour that enhances the story with loveable characters that bounce off each other and have great chemistry Say what you will about Iron Man Three, but at least that *was* a Shane Black film. It felt like the work of a director. 

Homecoming is gonna be populated by teenage characters, and Shane Black proved himself more than apt at writing loveable, hilarious child actors with Angourie Rice's character (who will also be in Homecoming). I mean, just listen to Homecoming's humour and writing.

&gt; We should stop before it gets creepy, though.

&gt; Too late, you guys are losers. 

And:

&gt; No... no I'm not. Th... this is just a costume.

&gt; Y... you were on the ceiling. 

Now listen to Shane Black's writing:

&gt;""Detroit killed my daughter.""

&gt; ""Yeah. Whole city had a vote. Everyone showed up.""

[And the protest scene from The Nice Guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK3zmAIqYM8)

And his writing for child characters:

&gt; Holly: Dad, there's like whores here and stuff.

&gt; Holland March: Sweetheart, how many times have I told you? Don't say ""and stuff"". Just say ""dad, there are whores here"".

&gt; Holly: Well, there's like a ton.

I just find Black's humour more inventive and creative, while HC sounds like a run of a mill comedy that looks like a TV film. The writing sounds generic and they're making Ned out to be an annoying character. The thing is, the writers of the movie have a shoddy track record, having written the terrible 2015 ""Vacation.""

I could be proven wrong just like I was with GoTG, but at this point the trailer didn't inspire much hope.

Here's my pitch for doing Miles Morales in Homecoming. It's a fairly radical change to the established lore, but I think it works well as drama. Plus, I REALLY wanna see Glover as a Spidey type

OK so Miles is like a student science teacher or an intern at Oscorp (go for student teacher cos I'm kinda amalgamating Miles/Harry slightly). He and Peter strike up a friendship thanks to their love of science. Miles is more outgoing than Peter and interacts with MJ/Flash etc. as he's only 5-10 years older. Miles helps to introduce him and MJ so Peter feels indebted to him. At some point Miles talks about not being able to help people in real world because he's preoccupied with studies and stuff + maybe talks about respecting Spidey for this reason. Eventually he finds Peter's suit and convinces him to teach him about being Spidey. This is where the ""great power/great responsibility"" comes in. Miles realises that the webshooters and other tech show science can be used for good. He develops his own suit and they form a team. So you have Peter coming out of his shell thanks to Miles and Miles realising his full potential + value of his skill set thanks to Peter. This sets them up as kinda ""brothers"" to each other

If they connected the animated movie to the MCU, I'd want that as a Miles story. Peter might be wanting to go on a date with MJ so Miles covers for him on a regular robbery or something. This means Miles misses going out with friends (Flash or Eddie I guess?). One Spidey wins, one Spidey loses. Could be Miles' first solo job and this is where he learns that Spidey takes sacrifices. He accepts this and fully becomes that figure in both his + Peter's eyes

I know these are huge deviation from the comics version of Miles, but I see them both being strong dramatic story with the fundamental ideas of Spidey without losing the essence of Peter or Miles despite the big changes.

Let me know what you think. Does anyone else have ideas for who Donald Glover might play or other pitches for Peter/Miles stories?","4o99hf",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

It just seems like the most positive discussion surrounding the movie is from people who are hoping that despite what the trailers show they manage to deliver something solid, that's it. Meanwhile Thor: Ragnarok &amp; Black Panther are already being held in high regard despite being a long while off (and their trailers were huge hits).

It's even worse since this is Spider-Man and it's expected that he will do well with the GA. Is there a chance this could be Marvel's first real (movie) flop?

I don't really know how to start this off other than saying I am a huge, huge, huge Spider-Man fan. HUGE! I've been looking towards Spider-Man: Homecoming for the longest time and a few days ago I missed out on grabbing tickets to go see it on Wednesday next week. I know they give more tickets than they can seat people, and not everyone ends up showing up so if you are someone that so happens to have gotten one and know that you won't make it to the screening next week I'd be so grateful to have it.

I've been a huge Spider-Man since I can remember. When I was 11 I would get home from school each day and look up news for the then upcoming The Amazing Spider-Man movie. It was also that summer that I would walk daily to the library and pick up Spider-Man comics. i have read every 'Essential Amazing Spider-Man' volume clackamas library has to offer. I bought a PS4 in anticipation for the Spider-Man game being made. To say the least, Spider-Man has been a big part of my life. Check my reddit acitivity over at /r/marvelstudios and /r/spiderman if you want more proof!


Thanks!

Following that, and the Sony and Marvel logos, things will jump into the middle of Civil War, just after Tony Stark has recruited Peter to his side of the fight. A montage will show Peter’s exploits in leaving New York, riding on a private jet to Germany, and taking place in the big airport fight.

He didn't sign the Sokovia Accords which makes him a wanted man, would a school really show a video with a wanted man teaching about exercise? I find this funny, it doesn't really bother me, but let me know if you think otherwise. Maybe he's just a huge American icon, and a big part of history that they just show him.

This means the title should also reflect the change that ""Homecoming"" represents.

Homecoming refers the Spidey's introduction to the established MCU (and also the homecoming dance to a degree). If Marvel calls Fantastic Four the same title, they'll lose people. So, I think I've come up with the perfect title - FANTASTIC FOUR: REFORMED.

A title like ""Reformed"" would be Marvel's way of putting their own stamp of the franchise in the same way they're doing with ""Homecoming"" as well as tell audiences it's something new and not something to be annoyed at. Also, the definition of reformed is ""make changes in order to improve"", which fits FF considering its cinematic past.

Also, like Spider-Man - Maintain the original costumes while also putting an MCU spin on them. As for the ""space exploration '60s"" versus ""alternate dimensions"" thing - I'm not sure because the MCU can easily do both. However, I'm more of a fan of the alternate dimensions thing because it feels more contemporary.

Thoughts anyone?","5igh1a",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

Then, once Peter finds a girl who actually likes him (Betty Brant), and beats Flash in the boxing match, Liz suddenly starts to like him, showing she probably cares less about his personality and more about dating the alpha-male (she does say to Flash a lot about ""oh, you don't have any brains so that's why I don't like you"", which begs the question of why are you just now deciding this after Peter uses his brawn?). So, now that she totally ""likes"" him, she begins to constantly interfere in Peter's budding relationship with Betty Brant, screwing everything up for everyone else. It's not comic book accurate to have Liz Allan because she was Peter's ""first love interest"", because very early on he basically starts to not give a shit about her! Betty Brant should be the lead in this movie if you are going to make that stupid accuracy argument (but there isn't even a Daily Bugle, which is another rant).

MCU Liz Allan seems to have much more in common with Earth -1610 MJ (pretty smart girls interested in Peter), excluding the fact that Liz will probably be popular in the movie and won't be a longtime friend of Peter. However, if you are going to make Liz Allan not Liz Allan, why call her Liz Allan!? Just rename her MJ, because that is basically who she is going to be. Oh, and would you like to know what Earth-1610 Liz Allan is like? She is a popular girl who doesn't understand why MJ even likes Peter! She is a mutant-hater, who later turns out to be a mutant. It's not ""fresh"" or ""different"" because it is basically turning Liz Allan into a character we have already seen on the big screen before.

Liz Allan eventually gets better and more mature in both universes, but I still hate her early incarnations and very strongly believe she shouldn't be in the new movie.","6jonpv",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

I predict that we will get a *Doctor Strange* cameo in *Spider-Man: Homecoming*. 
I'm guessing to be in the form of either A) Spider-Man swings into/lands on the Sanctum Sanctorum by accident, causing a **thud** noise which we then cut to Strange reacting to.
OR
B) Much like the Avengers tower appearing *Doctor Strange*, Spider-Man will walk/swing past the Sanctum Sanctorum in a split second cameo. Not a cameo by Strange himself, but a piece of *Strange* iconography.

In *Guardians*, I don't imagine that we will see Strange himself (unless he walks out of a Sling Ring Portal, or something) but I would imagine that we'll see an alien performing magic. A giant, multi-armed alien casting runes and using magic whips seems like exactly the kind of thing Gunn would be up for.","5hpfbm",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

(maybe Ant-Man but I really like the juxtaposition between him and the super serious villain and hope they continue that in the sequel). I feel like Homecoming is going to be more about Peter and him struggling with balancing his life (school, romance, job etc.) than a huge big bad, so wouldn't it make sense to have him fight a silly villain instead of Norman Osborn or someone like that? I understand that Spidey has his own rogues gallery and would love to see Mysterio and others at some point but MODOK could fit well into this movie. Plus you already have the AIM connection and Tony is in this movie so they could make it work plot wise (giving Tony a reason for being there). Maybe he could be one of the villains not the only one.

So, I was wondering... What do you think will be the plot of Spider-Man: Homecoming? Based on the released stuff, I have:
- Flashback: Toomes &amp; crew cleaning 
- Flashback: Civil War vlogs (battle, hotel)
- Present day: Tony &amp; Peter talking in car
- Daytime crime fighting / Peter calls Tony to report everything
- School: Peter watching YouTube video's of himself (he is bored)

[...]

- Homecoming party
- Peter VS The The Shocker buses
- Warehouse: Peter talks with Toomes
- Toomes leaves, Peter fights with a Vulture-robot thing
- Toomes heads to The Avengers building, where he snoops in the airplane loaded with Avengers weaponry (to disable Iron Man's suit?)
- Toomes heads back for his suit and attacks the airplane: Peter arrives to battle him
- The plane crashes on a beach - final fight
- Tony thinks Peter proved himself and he joins The Avengers

[...] = ferry fight scene, Washington Monument fight scene, neighbourhood fight scene, ATM fight scene... A lot of fight scenes... But Idk where to place them","6e03z6",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

Here's why:

- A new Spider-Man reboot not too long after the last one. Everyone knows the guy and knows what to expect, kind of. It lacks the curiosity value of Dr. Strange or GotG.

- Most likely a low-key story and event. While this is a welcome change of pace among the grandness of Strange and Thor, I feel like this combined with point number 1 will make many critics to ""meh"".

Overall I think Homecoming will need to be exceptional to get a decent reception. Iron-Man 2 levels of ""it's okay"" will translate into a 56% RT score for this one. What do you guys think?","59begy",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

However, my major qualm with the Avengers movies is how watered down they get by just cramming as many super-heroes as they can into one movie. 

There's very little room for individual development when they all get equal screen time. It's just the band of heroes fighting together for the greater good against evil. Now, I'm not saying that isn't an interesting idea. Who doesn't want to see a bunch of super-heroes kicking ass together against the bad guys? I certainly do, but not in *every* goddamn movie. It's no longer interesting to me when the stakes are SO high every time that most problems are solved with massively cataclysmic battle sequences. Maybe Marvel Studios is trying to keep it interesting by just adding more and more heroes to the mix? I don't know, but it doesn't sit well with me. 

It didn't really bother me that much until my favorite super-hero was introduced to the universe by being shoehorned into another hero's movie. I get that Marvel Studios was excited about getting Spider-Man back, but writing him into Civil War only detracted from the main plot and belittled Spider-Man as an individual character. Now I'm worried that he will just be another addition to the Avengers plot lines and won't get the individual expansion that I think he deserves. Homecoming already has Iron Man listed in the credits, so that's another reason for concern about Avengers tie-ins being a part of any Spider-Man arc.

I'm sure fans have been already discussing this. In a previous post, I explained that I doubt Venom would make an appearance next year, which is fine, but I love Venom. Always loved him as a kid and loved the way he wanted to ruin Peter's life and messing with his head. Since Venom is off the table, let's talk who I think would be my top choices for villains. My number 5 is The Green Goblin. Willem Dafoe did perfect as Norman O. but I think he definitely needs a reboot. Number 4 is going to be Doctor Octopus. Again, Alfred Molina was excellent. One of the main reasons I love Spider-Man 2. I just want to see what Marvel Studios can do with him. Number 3 is Kraven. The comic storyline, Kraven's Last Hunt would be really interesting to see on screen. This character would be great because I am a huge fan and we haven't seen him on screen yet. Number 2 is Mysterio. He would bring a different feel for Spider-Man films for sure, and I believe it can set up Sinister 6 Team Up. My number 1 is CARNAGE. The reason I pick him as my top choice for Homecoming, is that he is brutal. Cletus Kasady would be an amazing villain on screen. This guy is even more brutal than Venom. Even so, Venom and Spider-Man teamed up to fight this creature. But let me know what you guys think. I'll have a video up on my YouTube channel soon about this article as well and go in even more depth. I hope to hear your feedback. Do you agree with my choices? Are there different enemies you would like to see on here? As of right now, these are my top 5 picks. Please give a like, comment, subscribe to my YouTube channel, tumblr, and Instagram for more articles and videos. Thanks guys talk to you soon.","4jsm0o",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

By the title alone you could assume that it could literally adapt the print run ""Homecoming"", but I think that story is lame and find that Kraven's Last Hunt *COULD* be summed up with such a subtitle.

Parker is in the ground, and May doesn't know where he is.  She's anxiously waiting for him to come home.  Seems pretty easy.  The story could be very emotionally poignant.  Marisa Tomei is getting a lot of press.  Marvel is pushing her into the spotlight as May, which is understandable, since she's an Oscar winning actress.

I could be emotionally involved in watching her up late at nights pondering in some traumatic fashion what could have happened to him.  First Ben is gone; now Peter...  She is alone.  It's dark out and the rain is pounding against the glass.  The wind is howling.  She's crying.  The lights are out in the house... Maybe a candle or nightlight.

Spider-man; fresh from digging his way out of the grave stumbles up the walk. He's bloody.  He's bruised.  He's filthy. His costume is destroyed.  The tattered rags of what remains of his mask are dangling between his fingers.  He fumbles with the knob. It's unlocked.

The storm rages outside as the door creeks open a flash of lightning illuminates the scene.  May is aghast, terrified, saddened and relieved all at once.

Peter has come home.","4elnar",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

Now of course, this would be a dream come true if this actually happened. But what if I told you something like this has already happened in a previous Marvel movie? That's because it has! In Spider-Man 2, when Jonah and his employee (I can't remember his name) are coming up with the name for Otto, the one character suggests Doctor Strange. Jonah likes it by remarks that it's already taken.

I just got out of an early screening for Spider-Man: Homecoming. [Proof] (http://i.imgur.com/w4FxnyA.png?2) 

**Overall, I enjoyed this film**. It has more jokes than I anticipated, so I would definitely consider it to be one of the more comedic superhero films. I probably won't go out and watch this again in theaters, but I can see myself watching this again once it's available for streaming. If you have the time, money, and interest, then I would recommend you go see it in theaters! If you don't, then I would recommend catching it once it goes to DVD/Steaming. 

Without getting into spoilers/too plot heavy, here are some initial thoughts: Tom Holland gave a good performance - if you enjoyed him in Civil War, then I think that you'll enjoy him in this. I also liked Ned (Jacob Batalon), Peter's sidekick/best friend. I didn't find him to be grating or too annoying. I'm still not entirely sure how I feel about Michelle (Zendaya). The audience that I saw this with LOVED (laughing incredibly loud) every scene she was in and every line she said, but my initial feeling is that she was average/borderline annoying (I don't know if it's because I don't like the script she was given or if I don't love her performance - it's probably a little bit of both). I wasn't 100% sold on the villain's motivation (although, it's probably better than some superhero villains), but I also wasn't expecting them to have an elaborate/complex backstory - so I wasn't too bothered by it.  Some of the action is a little indiscernible and choppy. However, I had terrible seats and that could be why I didn't love all of the action scenes. 

######For context/To see if our movie tastes align:

Recent Mainstream Superhero/Comic Book Films - I enjoy most MCU films (Captian American: Winter Soldier is my favorite so far and I was really bored/underwhelmed by Dr. Strange) and I really enjoyed Wonder Woman. Spidey Sidenote: I love the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man films, but have not seen the Andrew Garfield ones. 

Recent Things I've Watched - I really loved Wright's Baby Driver and I'm rewatching Futurama. I also just finished GLOW and loved it! 


If you've also been able to catch this film, I'd love to know your thoughts!","6k5mfx",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

Marvel has to step up their game with their star pupil if they want to be the guys that really understand Spider-Man. It seems like this new movie is doing a lot of those things too.

We have a younger Peter, who's poor and in high school for perhaps the entire trilogy. 
An amazing look suit with webshooters. 
The web being made by Peter *and not by OsCorp* (seriously how could Sony fuck that up?)

Obviously, the matter of one thing being there or not isn't going to make or break this film but personally, I would love to see Peter have his inner monologue like he did in the comics. I want Peter to think about the situation or crack jokes in his mind while he's in or out the suit. You can even have the cool split between his face and the spidey mask.

The OSCORP building makes an appearance; Norman Osborn and his son, however, are only namedropped and probably will appear in the next movies.

There are references and cameos of Anna Watson, Jalome Beacher, Miles Warren, Ned Leeds, Alystair Smythe, Otto Octavious and a small reference to JJJ.

In the original draft, Stark's role was supposed to be ""very small"", but the studio decided to expand his role due to RDJ demands.
Zendaya is playing MJ. ""Michelle"" was the name of her role in the original draft and this was going to be her only movie. However, after the public's backlash, the studio is thinking about reducing her role again, editing out every references to ""Mary Jane"".

Same thing with Revolori's Flash

Jon Watts wants the movie to have Raimi's level of appraisal. He's trying to make this movie follow carefully every path the first Spidey movie took.

Watts originaly envisioned it as a 2 hour movie, but thanks to Kevin Feige, some scenes never made filming and other are likely going to be choopped in post-production

Feige wants THREE credits scenes for this one (One about with 
Spidey, Tony and accords, another about Black Panther, last one centers on Thanos starting a ramapage across the galaxy

Spidey isn't in the first ""Infinity War"" movie aside from a brief appearance. The movie mostly deals with Thanos' arrival on Earth to reclaim the remaining Infinity Stones and a tense standoff between him and the world governments with the Avengers caught in the crossfire. Peter Parker shares a scene with Tony Stark early on and later appears in the third act helping evacuate civilians, before making a final appearance joining the other heroes as they prepare to stop Thanos.

In the second, yet untitled movie, Spidey has a much larger role as he ventures into the battle with Thanos in space and interacts with most characters, being one of the sources of comic relief.
Aside from Iron Man, they'll really build up to his relationship with Captain America and he'll also have some banter with the Falcon. The game-changer is that the movie will end with Spidey getting the alien symbiote, which ends up returning to Earth with him and sets up Venom for a Homecoming sequel and beyond.

Movie starts with a News Outlet about hostage situation by criminal band ""The Diablos"". Jalome Beacher, their leader, demands an helicopter and bags of money for their lives. Actually, he knows he is not going to get none of them, so he proceeds to put an explosive to blow up the building in order to boost their popularity as criminals. He then proceeds to rant about how stupid the whole thing is with one of his goons, Herman Schultz, who came up with the idea of the hostage taking.

Spider-Man swings into the scene and defeats them except for one, Herman Schultz, who escapes after taking the wallet of one of the hostages. 
&gt;Costumed freak who are you?
&gt;Do you even have TV? I'm your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man!
&gt;Why your suit is so horrible?
&gt;Sorry if it's a little dirty. Your mom, washed it for me.
Herman attemps to get away from the scene stealing a kid's bike, but Spidey appears and webs him up.
&gt;As expecte
The cops and the hostages praise Spidey for saving the day.
*Marvel Studios*
We see Spidey swinging through the city, taking his backpack from one of the buildings, doing acrobatics and such. The triumphant music rises until he runs out of webbing
and crashes into the pavement, scaring a bunch of hobos. He pulls out his watch and realizes he's late so he jumps onto a truck.
Pete makes it to the school (after taking off his costume), but gets reprimanded by his teacher. His life is pretty shit: Girls think he is creepy, he sucks at sports, constantly gets rejected by everyone, etc. 

Peter has a crush on Liz Allan, the most popular girl from school, and wishes to take her to the Homecoming dance next month. The problem here is named Flash Thompson, who has been making advances on her and looks like he will be the one that will take her to the dance.

Flash comes from a upper middle class family and is a local football star. He is also a troublemaker, has daddy issues and tends to fail tests, even though he tries hard to get good notes. This is why despises Peter. 

Then there is this girl, ""Michelle"", who is attracted to Peter but tends to act cold and hostile to him.

Adrian Toomes is a famous enginner that works for George Brody, who bought HAMMER Industries a few years ago and tries to make weapons from Chitauri tecnology. Along with Toomes, people like Otto Octavius, Phineas Horton and Alystair Smythe works in the project.

I recently stumbled upon the apparent leaked footage of Spider-Man: Homecoming from Comic-Con (I won't post the link incase it's not allowed), and only today a thought came to my head after seeing a picture of a villain from Earth-616.

Towards the end of the clip, we see what looks like Venom and what one person actually speculated to be Venom, however I don't believe it is. I came across a picture of Superior Venom from the comics, which I believe is the character we see towards the end of the clip. I'm not sure how to post pictures, so type in Google ""Superior Venom"" and see for yourself. 

I don't know a great amount about the Marvel Universe and/or Earth 616 and I'm not great at Reddit so yeah, I'll just hope this post is alright. Post if you agree with me or not in the comments below, thanks.

He becomes Peters inspiration after becoming spider-man. Eventually Peter finds him and finds out who he is and he becomes a mentor to peter.  

As the movie goes on the two develop a friendship. You could even have Miles team up with Spidey at the end. Have Miles suit up one last time. Then if you ever wanted to do a trilogy based on Miles it could ether be a prequel of him becoming spider-man or a sequel about him coming out of retirement after Peters death far into the future.

I wanted to explain my thoughts and opinions on the 2017 film ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"". Well all love Spider-Man. Especially after Tom Holland's performance as our latest web-slinger portrayal. He's funny, smart, brilliant character and he's the Peter Parker we all know and love. As I've said before, 'Spider-Man 2' is my favorite Spidey movie. When they rebooted in 2012, I didn't grasp the characters. I had a rough time enjoying it and I didn't connect with Andrew Garfield's performance. Thank goodness Tom Holland saved the day. Also Marvel Studios for making him happen. I'm very excited for the next movie I don't have any doubts about it. I want to know what you guys think. Are you guys ready for 'Spider-Man: Homecoming'? I hope you enjoyed his post please show me your support, give a LIKE, COMMENT, &amp; SUBSCRIBE. Stay tuned for  my next post: Who will be cast as the villain for upcoming Spider-Man films? Let me know what you guys think. 
Also, don't forget to check out my main channel on YouTube ReedMyReviews. Thanks guys, and talk to you soon.","4js3iy",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

Love to inference big budget superhero movies a lot. The worst example is between Spider-Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Here's a quote from Tom Rothman who is the chairman of Sony from this page https://www.comicbookmovie.com/spider-man/sony-still-wants-a-shared-spider-man-universe-but-current-creative-a142856 

Since you teamed with Marvel, do you plan to make a whole Spider-Man universe? Do you have plans for more work with Marvel?
 
""Yes to both those questions. It’s been fantastic, our relationship with Marvel.""
 
Who has greenlight authority?
 
""Sony has the ultimate authority. But we have deferred the creative lead to Marvel, because they know what they’re doing. We start shooting the new Spider-Manin Atlanta [in mid-June].""
 
Do you want to trim the costs of that franchise?
 
""I don’t want to trim costs. I want to make money. And sometimes you make money by trimming costs and sometimes by investing in things that are profitable. A movie like Spider-Man by Marvel, that’s not inexpensive. But it’s a great investment. Knowing that Marvel has such a clear, creative vision, I sleep very well at night.""

Tom Rothman just say ""I want to make money"" and that's a big issue with me about Studio Executives. He infamously inference both The Last Stand and Origins: Wolverine and he allegedly HATED Deadpool for NO GOOD reason. He doesn't care about quality of movie.... NO! He care about money! He is NOT role model for anyone!

I'm feared that Sony or Rothman going to inference the film since they announced a Venom spin-off movie with NO MCU Connection.","5zuhmv",0,"Spider-Man: Homecoming",175000000,880024498,80.1141899574709

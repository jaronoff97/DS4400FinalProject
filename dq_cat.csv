**Information:**
Tired of all the mil-sim bullshit? Tired of having to salute every two seconds? Tired of having to form perfect wedges, columns, and lines? Tired of having to eat, speak, and shit ArmA? So are we! That's why, not to long ago, myself and two friends founded ISAF: the Independent State Allied Forces. At ISAF, we dont expect you to know everything, have perfect radio calls, and attend EVERY FUCKING OP. We just want you to show up, learn shit, and have fun! Want to be an auto-rifleman one day and a grenadier next? You can do that! Want to be flying at 3000 meters one day and under water the next? You can do that! 

**But what if you do want that professional, Mil-sim feel?**
Well, we have that to. Our leading members have been both Mil-sim hard-asses and casual plebeians since the dawn of Operation: Flash-point. We understand that feeling of clearing towns and rescuing hostages with pin-point accuracy. That's why we have a division dedicated to Mil-sim, too. 


But, what if you want to play games other than ArmA 3? Again, that's possible too. Currently (besides ArmA 3) we offer:

ArmA 2

ArmA 2: OA

Battlefield 4

Rainbow Six Siege

War-hammer 40k

War Thunder

And more!

**What to expect in Game:**
Everything is different. There could be hostage rescue, black hawk down, D-Day like invasions, or Bin Laden style raids. The best part is every single mission is member driven! Members get to pick the scenario, map, and methodology of attack. Then, the command structure generates missions based on those parameters, which is a balance of fun, and surprise. We also have a constant campaign going on, too. Fulfill missions on a whole island, push back an occupying force, led by you and your fellow squad mates.

**What to expect out of Game:**
In the end, we're not douche bags. We care about our members. Out of game, ranks mean nothing. In game, ranks are ONLY for chain of command. Anyone who uses it otherwise is demoted. We want you to have fun, but not in a way that requires you to do shit that you don't want to do. We will push you forward, not away.


**Requirements to Join:**

* Continental US (sorry not sorry)

* No age limit; don't be a jackass

* At least show your face in teamspeak once a month. Again, we care about you, and want to know if you're okay.

* Multi-unit is perfectly okay, so long as YOU can handle it.

* MUST own a LEGITIMATE copy of ArmA 3

* You have to be able to download Teamspeak

* Microphone of some sort

* Apex NOT required

I think the thing I've always found so compelling about Task Force X is that, especially in its more recent line ups, has been that the entire thing is insanity crashing into order. It's controlled chaos, the government trying to direct a raging fire to only burn *certain* things. But as we all know, fire spreads easily, it can be unpredictable. How precise can military precision be when you fill a special operations group with clowns, assassins, and criminals? 

Let's find out. 

Let's write a roleplay where we throw some super villains, military tropes, government overreach, some good old fashioned smut, throw it all into a blender and hit 'puree'. 

So what's it going to be? Two members of the Squad getting too close? Harley Quinn getting a little too obsessed with the unit's handler? (Anyone who wants to play Harley will go to the front of the line) Enchantress mind controlling a few guards to help her to escape? Maybe just a couple of OCs who are only tangentially connected to this all? As long as you can write I think we'll get along swimmingly!

Feel free to mix and match super villains as you see fit, I'm not someone to be a stickler in terms of the roles you want to maybe play, I want to give you as much leeway as possible. 

Kinks can be variable and open for discussion! Hard limits are skat, vomit, watersports. 

Can't wait to get started!
